Clarence Saunders is often credited as the father of the modern-day supermarket with his self-service Piggly Wiggly stores providing grocery needs as far back as 1916.

In Western Massachusetts, there have been numerous supermarket chains that have served shoppers, most notably the D'Amour family's Big Y.

In 1936, Paul D'Amour, a route sales driver for Wonder Bread, opened the Y Cash Market with his brother Gerald in Chicopee. The brothers opened a second and larger Y Cash Market in a former bowling alley in 1947. Building on their success they opened a 31,000-square-foot Big Y in Northampton in 1960. It was the largest supermarket in Western Massachusetts.

Other popular chains over the years have included Stop & Shop, A&P and Food Mart.

Here is a look back at where many of us have done their grocery shopping over the years.
