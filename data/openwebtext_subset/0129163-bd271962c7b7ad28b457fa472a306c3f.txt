Red Bulls II heads into Sunday looking to continue their momentum after another nail biting shootout victory over Louisville City FC. This is the first ever matchup between the two teams.

Red Bulls II is led by leading regular season and playoff goal scorer Brandon Allen, who had 15 goals in the regular season and three goals so far in the playoffs. Florian Valot leads NYRB II with six assists in the regular season and three assists this postseason. In goal, Ryan Meara leads the way with just 20 goals allowed through 24 games played.

Red Bulls II has now extended its unbeaten streak to 13 games and has won seven consecutive games at Red Bull Arena.

Swope Park Rangers will be a worthy opponent, as they are on a seven-game win streak heading into Sundayâ€™s match. Their +7 goal differential is easily the highest in the playoffs.

Mark Anthony Gonzalez has led the attack with nine regular season goals, while Ayrton Pinheiro Victor recorded seven assists. Goalkeeper Adrian Zendejas has only played in eight games this season for Swope Park, but has been extremely stingy this postseason with 1 goal allowed in 300 minutes played. The Rangers have seen three red cards in the three postseason games, so that will be something to watch for in this game.
