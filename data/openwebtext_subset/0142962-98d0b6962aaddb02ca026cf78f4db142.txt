Why your boring job is a great opportunity

A few years back, right after university, I got a boring job. I was working in a big corporation with older, slower, less motivated people. I wanted to work in a startup, a young, dynamic environment with highly competent and motivated people. At first, I felt unlucky for getting this boring job, while some of my friends were working in inspiring and popular startups.

Looking back, I realize how that boring job was probably one of the best things that ever happened to me. It made me look at my situation and tell myself “This is not acceptable. You gotta do something to fix this problem”. It made me realize that enjoying life is about overcoming challenges and getting stronger. I changed my mindset from “What did I do to deserve this boring job?” to “What can I do to fix this situation?”, and my mind started flocking with new ideas and inspirations. I felt empowered, the most empowered I had ever felt in my life. Taking full responsibility for my circumstances had given me the strength to deal with my problems, instead of blaming others.

You guys who consider your job as boring are extremely lucky. You have a challenge in front of you that is an amazing opportunity for personal growth.
