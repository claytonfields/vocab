As the news was breaking that Russia had invaded Ukraine, a connection was made that Sarah Palin had in fact predicted this event back in 2008; something for which she was repeatedly chastised. To the delight of Palin supporters, this "prophetic fulfillment" allowed the oft-leveled "ditzy" label to be replaced with a more proper respect for Palin's insight.

Even some leftist papers had to admit this, if only slightly.

PolicyMic gave props to Palin as well as Mitt Romney, who took criticism from Obama throughout the 2012 campaign. Obama said Romney would drag the country back into the Cold War. And so their headline showed this admission, "Sarah Palin and Mitt Romney Predicted Ukraine's Invasion Years Ago."

The Huffington Post was a little more resistant. They said she was "relishing" in her "told-ya-so" moment. They simply did not like her taking to Facebook to point out the obvious.

The Daily Beast files this story under "Spooky" and warns:

Not to alarm everyone, but Sarah Palin may be able to tell the future.

Sometimes humble pie is hard to swallow, but these leftist papers sure got a heaping helping.
