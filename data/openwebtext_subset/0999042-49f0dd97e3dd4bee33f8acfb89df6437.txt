THE GOVERNMENT reckons laws on “suicide websites” are too lax and need rewriting before they do serious damage.

Times are hard, and a recent spate of suicides has prompted the government to take a closer look at information available online about easy, painless ways to kick the bucket.

Under a 1961 Suicide Act it is illegal to promote suicide in the UK, but that hasn’t stopped hundreds of web sites and forums popping up offering lethal advice.

UK Justice Minister, Maria Eagle, reckons there isn’t a "magic solution " to protecting suicidal maniacs online.

But with nothing better to do with its time and dwindling financial reserves, the Government has decided to amend the law and make it more obvious it applies online too.

In other words, ‘If we can’t make people financially secure and happy enough to not want to do themselves in, we can at least make it bloody difficult for them to do so!’

The news comes just months after boffins at the British Medical Journal conducted a survey which concluded the Internet was more likely to encourage people to top themselves than talk them out of it. µ
