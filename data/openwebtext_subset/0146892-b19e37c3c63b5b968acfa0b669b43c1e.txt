The latest numbers out from one Saskatoon real estate company suggest the market is flush with brand new condominiums, and that is driving the price down.

"New units resulting from condominium development projects that started two years ago are now coming onto the market and generating a spike in inventory," said Norm Fisher with Royal LePage.

The number of new condominiums currently for sale in Saskatoon is up 35 per cent over last year, according to the report by Royal LePage.

"This is leading to some price softness in the condominium segment and creating a window of opportunity for buyers."

The average price for a condo is $226,186 right now. That's 10.1 per cent less than last year.

The price for two story homes in the city, meanwhile, is up slightly, while the average price for a bungalow is down less than 1 per cent. Overall, the average price of a home in the city in the first quarter of 2016 remains virtually unchanged at $373,658.
