As the Wonder Festival 2014 Coverage begins to slow down for Transformers, we get to the strangest possible story from tonight. Teased a while back via Takara Tomy’s webpage, the long teased shadow of a possible Megatron toy in their upcoming Takara Tomy ARTS toyline has been revealed to be something quite strange indeed: A Transforming Sega Mega Drive (Or Sega Genesis, for North American readers) that turns into a Generation 1 Megatron.

No, that’s not a typo, and no you’re not hallucinating.

Part of a partnership with SEGA, this upcoming release is part of a subline of Takara Tomy ARTS alongside Video Game Robotics HD and Microman Arts, and while the prototype itself is extremely rough, a recently placed sign by staff members working the display has revealed that the upcoming Transformers Crossovers/Device Label-esque toy will in fact transform from Sega Mega Drive to Megatron.

It is unknown if this toy is a one-shot release, or if this is merely a harbinger of what is to come into this fledgling toyline (One would hope an OptiSNES Prime would be there to combat Mega Drive Megatron) but stay tuned to TFW2005 as we bring you the latest (and sometimes strangest) news as it happens.
