We’ve all seen them before. Walk three blocks in Boston and you’re bound to encounter megaphone-wielding “Men of God” telling us we’re all going to Hell. But one little girl in Salem took exceptional offense to a proselytizing loudmouth attempting to ruin the sacred institution of Salem Halloween, so she told him what we’ve all secretly dreamed of saying.

I know I wrote yesterday about two Boston kids telling their Mom to shut up and how wrong it was, But I’m willing to make an exception to the “respect your elders” rule when said elder is telling everyone within earshot they’re going to Hell unless they subscribe to his very specific brand of Christianity. And in Salem on Halloween, no less! Let the Pagans have their day of fun in the unholiest of lands, and leave the sermons on every other sidewalk in Boston like you normally do.
