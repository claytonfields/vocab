.o0( #OpCannabis 01.20.2013 Press Release )0o.

Greetings Citizens of the World

We are Anonymous

We were writing this Press Release this one time…and then suddenly! a random Anon appeared and dropped tons of info on us. We will now present that info to you verbatim as it was presented to us. This information is some of the more recent developments in the plethora of medical benefits of Cannabis that have, against all logic and the best interest of humanity, remained largely unnoticed.

We largely suspect this to be the result of the medical industries inability to make money off of a naturally occurring plant that anyone can grow that can replace the $10,000 treatments your “Doctors” will force feed you. We absolutely implore you to TELL EVERYONE, Especially those you know that are suffering from any number of ailments and “terminal” illnesses that Cannabis has been shown to be surprisingly effective at treating.

This is hard evidence from the SCIENTIFIC community. Who are paid to conduct invaluable research. These people are not profiting off of your death. So they have exponentially less motive to withhold this information from you.

Before we get on with the goods. Let us also put forth a CALL TO ACTION for this years 04/20/2013. Instead of a mass smoke out, or a protest of a particular location. This year. On 04/20/2013 we have but one simple request. With Cannabis inevitably on peoples minds on 04/20 we are calling for each of you to simply convince one person to CURE THEMSELVES with Cannabis. The stories and subsequent documentation of your success will do more then any protest ever could.

The Science on Cannabinoids and Cancer

Summary:

Cannabinoids reduce the spread and growth of cancer cells, including breast cancer, oral cancer, colon cancer, and skin cancer.

Cannabinoids disrupt cancer cells’ metastasis and interrupt their usual cell cycle.

Cannabinoids make cancer cells kill themselves, without affecting healthy cells.

Cannabinoids reduce the spread of tumors and can lead to tumor regression.

Cannabinoids used in cancer treatment have no neurotoxic effects.

In no particular order:

(1) Cannabidiolic acid, a major cannabinoid in fiber-type cannabis, is an inhibitor of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell migration

Quotes

“Results of the current investigation revealed that CBDA inhibits migration of the highly invasive MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells, apparently through a mechanism involving inhibition of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A, coupled with an activation of the small GTPase, RhoA. It is established that activation of the RhoA signaling pathway leads to inhibition of the mobility of various cancer cells, including MDA-MB-231 cells.”

Meaning

Cannabidiolic acid reduces the spread of breast cancer cells, through a pathway that is already known for reducing the spread of other types of cancer cells.

Quotes

“[…] predominantly inhibitory effects on tumour growth and migration, angiogenesis, metastasis, and also inflammation have been described. Emerging evidence suggests that agonists of cannabinoid receptors expressed by tumour cells may offer a novel strategy to treat cancer.”

Meaning

Activating the cannabinoid receptors reduces the spread and growth of tumors, suggesting that cannabinoids could be a new way to treat cancer.

(3) Cannabinoids in intestinal inflammation and cancer

Basic info

Published in: Pharmacological Research (August 2009)

http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043661809000838

University of Naples Federico II (Italy)

Quotes

“Studies on epithelial cells have shown that cannabinoids exert antiproliferative, antimetastatic and apoptotic effects as well as reducing cytokine release and promoting wound healing. In vivo, cannabinoids – via direct or indirect activation of CB1 and/or CB2 receptors – exert protective effects in well-established models of intestinal inflammation and colon cancer.”

Meaning

Cannabinoids reduce the spread of cancer cells, disrupt these cells’ metastasis, make cancer cells kill themselves (apoptosis), promote the healing of wounds, and protect the body from inflammation and cancer.

Quotes

“When treated with WIN55,212-2 (non-selective), ACEA (CBr1-selective) or AM1241 (CBr2-selective) agonists in vitro, oral cancer cell proliferation was significantly attenuated in a dose-dependent manner. In vivo, systemic administration (0.013 M) of WIN55,212-2, ACEA, or AM1241 significantly attenuated cancer-induced mechanical allodynia. Tumor growth was also significantly attenuated with systemic AM1241 administration. Our findings suggest a direct role for cannabinoid mechanisms in oral cancer pain and proliferation. The systemic administration of cannabinoid receptor agonists may have important therapeutic implications wherein cannabinoid receptor agonists may reduce morbidity and mortality of oral cancer.”

Meaning

Cannabinoids significantly reduce the spread and growth of oral cancer cells.

(5) Endocannabinoid system modulation in cancer biology and therapy

Basic info

Published in: Pharmacological Research (August 2009)

Quotes

“Emerging evidence suggests that agonists of cannabinoid receptors, which share the useful property to discern between tumor cells and their non-transformed counterparts, could represent novel tumor-selective tools to treat cancer in addition to their already exploited use as palliative drugs to treat chemotherapy-induced nausea, pain and anorexia/weight loss in cancer patients. “

Meaning

Cannabinoids can tell the difference between healthy cells and tumor cells.

University of Otago (New Zealand)

Quotes

“Cannabinoids, the active components of the hemp plant Cannabis sativa, along with their endogenous counterparts and synthetic derivatives, have elicited anti-cancer effects in many different in vitro and in vivomodels of cancer. While the various cannabinoids have been examined in a variety of cancer models, recent studies have focused on the role of cannabinoid receptor agonists (both CB1 and CB2) in the treatment of estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer.”

Meaning

Cannabinoids have been shown to have anti-cancer effects in many different experiments.

University of Aberdeen (UK)

Strathclyde University (UK)

Quotes

“Cannabinoids-endocannabinoids are anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, anti-invasive, anti-metastatic and pro-apoptotic in most cancers, in vitro and in vivo in animals. They signal […] to induce cell cycle arrest, autophagy, apoptosis and tumour inhibition.”

“Evidence in vivo and in vitro shows EPA and DHA can form endocannabinoids that: (i) are ligands for CB1/2 receptors and possibly TRPV-1, (ii) have non-receptor mediated bioactivity, (iii) induce cell cycle arrest, (iii) increase autophagy and apoptosis, and (iv) augment chemotherapeutic actions in vitro.”

Meaning

Cannabinoids not only reduce the spread and growth of cancer cells but also kill cancerous cells. Cannabinoids stop cancer cells from continuing their usual cycle, tell them to eat each other, tell them to kill themselves, and generally reduce the spread of tumors.

(10) Anti-tumoral action of cannabinoids

Basic info

Published in: Nature Medicine (March 2000)

http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v6/n3/abs/nm0300_313.html

Complutense University (Spain)

Quotes

“9-Tetrahydrocannabinol, the main active component of marijuana, induces apoptosis of transformed neural cells in culture. Here, we show that intratumoral administration of 9-tetrahydrocannabinol and the synthetic cannabinoid agonist WIN-55,212-2 induced a considerable regression of malignant gliomas in Wistar rats and in mice deficient in recombination activating gene 2. Cannabinoid treatment did not produce any substantial neurotoxic effect in the conditions used.”

Meaning

THC makes cancer cells kill themselves. Cannabinoids led to a considerable regression of tumors in rats, but did not lead to neurotoxic effects.

(12) Inhibition of skin tumor growth and angiogenesis in vivo by activation of cannabinoid receptors

Basic info

Published in: The Journal of Clinical Investigation (January 2003)

http://www.jci.org/articles/view/16116

Complutense University (Spain)

Clemson University (USA)

Quotes

“In cell culture experiments pharmacological activation of cannabinoid receptors induced the apoptotic death of tumorigenic epidermal cells, whereas the viability of nontransformed epidermal cells remained unaffected. Local administration of the mixed CB1/CB2 agonist WIN-55,212-2 or the selective CB2 agonist JWH-133 induced a considerable growth inhibition of malignant tumors generated by inoculation of epidermal tumor cells into nude mice. Cannabinoid-treated tumors showed an increased number of apoptotic cells. This was accompanied by impairment of tumor vascularization, as determined by altered blood vessel morphology and decreased expression of proangiogenic factors (VEGF, placental growth factor, and angiopoietin 2). Abrogation of EGF-R function was also observed in cannabinoid-treated tumors. These results support a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of skin tumors.”

Meaning

Cannabinoids led to the suicide of skin cancer cells, but did not affect healthy skin cells. Cannabinoids considerably reduced the growth of skin cancer, and prevented the tumor from creating new blood vessels.
