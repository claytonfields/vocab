A longtime pal of Mayor de Blasio has collected $862,550 as a lobbyist for 14 clients since the mayor took office in 2014 – compared to $61,305 off a single client the previous 12 years, according to city records.

Harold Ickes – a mentor of the mayor and former Clinton administration official – operated out of Washington DC and didn’t even have a New York office until after de Blasio ascended to power.

Since then, Ickes has lined up some blue chip clients seeking city assistance.

They include the American Beverage Association, which has shelled out $180,000 trying to limit Health Department restrictions on sugary drinks; JP MorganChase, which paid $172,500 for what wound up being a failed bid to win subsidies to build new headquarters on the Far West Side; AEG Live, which shelled out $150,000 before scoring a permit to host a major music festival on Randall’s Island; and Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1181-1061, which spent $42,000 before Ickes delivered $42 million in taxpayer funds to boost private bus driver salaries.

AEG got its permit for the music festival Jan. 11 – the same day Ickes bundled $13,000 in donations for de Blasio’s re-election campaign.

In comparison, Ickes’ only client with city business during the 12 years of the former Bloomberg administration was the International Dairy Foods Association, which paid him $61,305 in 2007.

When asked about Ickes’ influence at City Hall, mayoral spokesman Peter Kardushin said, “Every day, individuals lobby New York City on a broad range of issues. All decisions by the de Blasio administration are made on the merits.”

Records show Ickes also enjoyed face-time with de Blasio.

He and business partner Janice Enright met with the mayor and First Lady Chirlane McCray over dinner for 90 minutes at Gracie Mansion in November 2014 to discuss JP Morgan; and Ickes met with de Blasio at City Hall for a half hour in August 2014 to discuss the bus-driver union’s salaries.
