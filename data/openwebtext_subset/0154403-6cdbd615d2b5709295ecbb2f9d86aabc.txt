Jack Whitehall is filming a Netflix special, Chortle can reveal.

The comic is recording three nights of his At Large show when he plays the Hammersmith Apollo between July 20 and 22.

Whitehall previously signed a deal with the screening giant for his travelogue Travels With My Father, in which he and his dad Michael, a former showbiz agent, visited Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.

Speaking to Chortle in February, Whitehall said of his At Large tour: 'I'll have to work out how much more I want to perform it live first, because once you commit it to a DVD or streaming service you've lost the chance to go and do it again. It's hard filming shows in arenas and making them work for a laptop screen. So I want to get a bit of distance over the summer to work out how I want to tailor it.'

Whitehall is the fifth UK comic after Jimmy Carr, Frankie Boyle, Katherine Ryan and Bridget Christie to record a stand-up show for the online streaming giant, but the third from the Hannah Chambers management stable after Carr and Boyle.

The hour-long special is being made by Tiger Aspect, who also made Travels With My Father, and much of Whitehall's recent broadcast work, including the forthcoming Sky 1 sitcom Bounty Hunters, the BBC's recent adaptation of Evelyn Waugh's Decline And Fall and his sitcom and subsequent movie, Bad Education.

The comic's previous specials, 2012's Jack Whitehall: Live and 2014's Jack Whitehall Gets Around, have previously been added to Netflix, where they can be found in category 'Slightly Inappropriate', alongside Little Britain and The Mighty Boosh.

Whitehall has also added extra dates at Cardiff's Millennium Centre on July 15 and at Manchester's O2 Apollo the following night in the build-up to the recording.
