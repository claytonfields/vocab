A witness to an altercation involving an off-duty Montgomery County, Maryland police officer was too afraid to publicly tell what she saw because she "fears retribution" from an "out of control" police officer who was "acting insanely" when he pulled a gun on men he got in a fight with after brushing one of them with his car.

COLLEGE PARK, Md. (WUSA) --- University of Maryland police are investigating the actions of an off-duty Montgomery County police officer who is accused of drawing his gun on two men with whom he was having a parking lot altercation during the University of Maryland-University of Connecticut football game here Saturday afternoon.



[...]A witness tells 9News that the officer was driving his personal car, an older model Honda Civic, when the car brushed a man who was carrying bottled water, splashing the witness. She says the man splashed the officer's car with the water. Other witnesses say the man threw his bottled water at the officer's car.



The witness says the off-duty officer, with a child in his car, got out of the car to confront the man and ended up in a fight with the man and one of the man's friends.



The officer eventually drew his gun, sending witnesses diving behind cars to get out of the way, she said. Watch the video report:







Montgomery County Police made headlines recently for beating up a renowned photographer, they claimed he "threw himself" to the ground and "smashed himself" against their police cruiser. They then staked out his house to intimidate him.
