I was teased by my present for a whole 24 hours as I came home to a FedEx slip on Wednesday night. By Thursday, I was bubbling with excitement, and the presents did NOT disappoint!

I had done a little internet stalking of my giver as he had messaged me to tell me it was on its way to me last week. A geek who loved tattoos, Star Wars, Harry Potter and reading? This was either going to go really, really well or really, really badly as those four things are pretty much at the top of my own interests.

Wrapped individually, with old timey string closures and lots of detail, my box unfolded on itself. A Star Wars lunch box surrounded by green, red and white tissue paper. A card atop more tissue wrapped things inside telling me not to open until I'd unwrapped everything.

And then.

There it was.

Coffee beans roasted with Maker's Mark.

And a handcrafted, orange metal up-vote ornament.

My gifter wrote a card admitting to some cyber-stalking of his own. (It's the internet after all - that's what we do.)

Given that I frequently tweet my love of bourbon and regularly tweet about my boyfriend, coffee, Matt could NOT have picked better gifts for me. And the vehicle of delivery? A metal Star Wars lunchbox like I had when I was a kid?

He wins all my up votes today! I instagrammed my present immediately with lots of capslock and squee'ing. A girlfriend's comment to the picture was "It's you in present form!" and she could not have been more right!

Thanks Matt!
