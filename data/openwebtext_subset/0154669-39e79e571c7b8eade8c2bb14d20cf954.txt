Ted Cruz has been rolling up delegates and positions on powerful rules committees in just about every state–except Michigan, where John Kasich’s organization locked him out in favor of Donald Trump.

Cruz’s Michigan leader, Saul Anuzis said Kasich “double-crossed” Cruz when they switched their votes behind closed doors and voted for Trump delegates.

Kasich’s campaign even sounded like Trumpkins defending the backstabbing.

Kasich’s delegate director in Michigan, Jeff Timmer, said the Cruz campaign broke their end of the deal when they tried to win all eight delegation seats. He said they finished their slate of Trump and Kasich candidates about 10 minutes before walking into the delegation meeting. “The Cruz campaign tried a takeover and they failed miserably,” Timmer said. “It backfired and they ended up with nothing. There’s been all these reports about how they’re out-organizing everybody. Not here.”

It’s becoming apparent that Kasich is staying in the race to benefit Trump, which most observers have seen as obvious for the past two months. Trump’s call for Kasich to exit the race seem more and more to have been a head-fake.

Kasich staying in might cost Trump a few votes, but even fewer delegates, especially if Kasich has already cut a deal with Trump for floor support at the convention. Kasich hurts Cruz the most, and that damage has mostly already been done. Regardless of the backstabbing in Michigan, Cruz should have enough support to keep rules such as 40a which limit the names placed in nomination to those who win eight states, barring Kasich from the delegate ballots.

Kasich may still have delusions of playing kingmaker in Cleveland, but it’s more likely that a deal between Kasich and Trump has already been cut at some level.
