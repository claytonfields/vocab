RIO RANCHO — The Sandoval County Sheriff’s Office is investigating the death of a man in Rio Rancho that is being called suspicious and appears to be a homicide.

Sheriff’s officials say deputies say deputies were called Wednesday afternoon to investigate an unattended death.

Deputies say they found 30-year-old Matthew Senter lying near his vehicle unresponsive.

They say Senter had an argument with his girlfriend the previous evening and left the residence.

He walked alone to his vehicle that was parked in a vacant lot that is owned by his friend.

Senter was found dead the following afternoon by his friends.

Sheriff’s officials are trying to determine the cause and manner of Senter’s death.

Senter’s body appears to have been found along or near a dirt road north of Southern Boulevard in Rio Rancho, where large, newer adobe homes have been built.

Neighbors described the neighborhood as quiet and said they rarely see police activity. One neighbor said he was unaware that the man’s body had been found nearby.

Rio Rancho police and the New Mexico State Police Crime Scene Unit are assisting in the homicide investigation.
