fyi rip if you are reading this I am not trying to speak for you...



ripster in the past seemed to like that people discuss and share his content.

As long as they give credit to him or any other original author for the work!



The biggest problem I have seen him have with it is when someone reposts one of his pictures or his other content and does not reference that it came from him. This happens all the time and despite some users negative opinion of this... Watermark your photos!



Ripster was right in promoting this idea. I do not know how many times I have seen people repost pics from ripster, reaper, tsangen, jdcarpe, and many more and not reference where the original came from. but we all know because of the watermark.
