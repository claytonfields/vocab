I run South Bay Film Society and sell over 1,000 tickets per month to film events. I have used Yapsody for selling tickets to my film events for over a year now, after switching from a couple other ticketing platforms. I have found Yapsody to be excellent in all respects.

The Yapsody platform makes it easy for me to set up my ticket sales for each event and is easy for my customers to navigate. The fee charged by Yapsody is lower than for most other services.

The thing that is particularly impressive with Yapsody is their customer service support. Any time I have had an issue come up, they have responded very quickly and resolved the problem very quickly.

I highly recommend Yapsody as the best ticketing service I have found in my 6 years of business.
