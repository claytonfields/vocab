CAPE CORAL, Fla. â€” Police shot and killed a man suspected of killing two others here Sunday.

The incident began when the suspect shot and killed a motorcyclist about 5:45 p.m. ET. Then, the suspect went to a Circle K gas station on Cape Coral Parkway and fatally shot one person and injured another.

Four minutes later, police stopped the suspect's car where the suspect resisted officers and was shot.

"It's shocking," said Sgt. Dana Coston, police spokesman, at a news conference.

Coston said the shooter, who has not been named, was armed and "violently resisting officers" when they confronted him, but no officers were injured.

Coston did not identify the officers involved Sunday, nor did he release additional details. But he said more information would be released Monday.

Two passengers in the vehicle with the suspect were injured in the shooting and taken to a hospital. Police could not confirm whether those two were shot by officers or the gunman.

Coston wouldn't go into detail as to how the officer-involved shooting took place, but he said officers "acted accordingly."

"This is a unique circumstance, a very tragic circumstance," Coston said.

Coston, in law enforcement about 20 years, said Sunday night is not one he'll forget.

"There are certain days that stick out in your mind, and this will definitely be one of those for me," he said.

He said the average number of homicides per year for Cape Coral is five; so far this year, there had been one homicide. Cape Coral, in southwest Florida, is 10 miles west of Fort Myers, Fla., and 131 miles south of Tampa.
