It is too easy to persuade the TTAB and Federal Circuit that marks sharing a significant element are likely to cause confusion. For example, in 2014 the TTAB refused to register "5 Golden Rings" for beer and malt liquor due to likelihood of confusion with "Gold Ring Vineyards" for wine. In its little FAQ, CDPR correctly notes that anyone would be fine using "cyberpunk" as a subordinate, descriptive element in a title. But I think there would be some litigation risk in a descriptive use where "cyberpunk" were more salient. Roy's Cyberpunk Adventure might face problems, even if John Smith: Adventures in a Cyberpunk Dystopian Society would not. On the non-descriptive side, I would even be a little worried about naming a puzzler in a cyberpunk world "Cypherpunk." I don't think CDPR would win that opposition, but there would be litigation risk--maybe enough to move me off the title.
