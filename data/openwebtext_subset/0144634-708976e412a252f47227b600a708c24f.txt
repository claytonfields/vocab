The Guardian science desk is hunting down the sharpest, funniest, most fascinating science blogs on the internet. And we need your help ...

Are there websites or blogs that you check every day? Places that you know you'll always find some worthwhile insights and analysis, or perhaps some guaranteed humour to keep things ticking along during those difficult afternoons? Are there places you turn to after news stories are published to make sure you've got the real story behind the latest cancer scare or acupuncture research?

With so many science-related blogs on the web, a good way to identify the most interesting ones, while blocking out the noise of the dud ones, is to ask your friends (real and virtual).

In that spirit, the Guardian's science desk want to share with you some of our favourite science-related blogs. Regular readers will be familiar with most of these scientific stars of the web and you'll notice that the list isn't very long - we're more interested in hearing what you read than what we read.

People argue endlessly about whether or not blogs are journalism but, frankly, that question is not what we're interested in here. We just want to find the places that are doing interesting things on the web and are being rewarded with engaged audiences, big or small.

So here, in no particular order, is our list:

If you know them already, tell us why you like them. If you've never seen them, we encourage you to check them out.

Most importantly of all we'd love to know your favourite science blogs and websites. The ones you wish you had thought of. The ones you can't spend a day without checking, or even the ones where you go to for a quick respite from real life. Either leave your thoughts below or tweet me (@alokjha) or the science team (@guardianscience) direct. We'll collate the suggestions over the next few days and post a list of readers' reccomendations.
