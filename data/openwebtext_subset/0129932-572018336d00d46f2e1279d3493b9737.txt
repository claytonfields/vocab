EXCLUSIVE: Comedy Central is betting big on actress-comedian Natasha Leggero. The comedian, who garnered a lot of attention with her wild set as a roaster at last year’s Comedy Central Roast Of James Franco, is a voice cast member of Comedy Central’s animated series Brickleberry and a recurring guest panelist on the network’s breakout new late-night show, @midnight. Now Comedy Central has greenlighted a scripted pilot starring and executive produced by Leggero and a stand-up special headlined by her.

The pilot, Another Period, hails from Ben Stiller’s Red Hour, with Drunk History co-creator/director Jeremy Konner directing. It was created by and stars Leggero and Riki Lindhome as Victorian-era heiresses. Shot reality style, the comedy follows the misadventures of Newport’s first family, The Bellacourts, a family with nothing to offer the world, but who have so much money that it doesn’t matter. The show centers around the oldest Bellacourt sisters, Lillian (Leggero) and Beatrice (Lindhome), who care only about how they look, what parties they are invited to and becoming famous — which is a lot harder in 1902. Leggero and Lindhome executive produce with Konner and Red Hour. Leggero previously starred on the first season of Red Hour’s popular online series Burning Love.

Leggero’s one-hour standup special will shoot in April at the Wilbur in Boston. Additionally, she has her web series Tubbin’ With Tash, recurs on Suburgatory and does frequent guest spots on Chelsea Lately. Leggero is with CAA, Brillstein Entertainment and attorney Lev Ginsburg, Lindhome and Konner are with WME.
