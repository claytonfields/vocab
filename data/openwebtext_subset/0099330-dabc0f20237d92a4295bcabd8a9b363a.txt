It’s already hard enough to part with a quarter-of-a-million dollars to buy a Ferrari 458 Italia, but can you imagine the rationale behind the man who would fork over that much money to buy a book?

Yeah, neither can we.

Now if you’re wondering if such a book even exists, then prepare to be introduced to the “Official Ferrari Opus”.

The book’s publisher, Opus Media Group, is calling it the “most exclusive book in the world”, and with the most expensive version retailing at $275,000, we find it hard to believe that there’s another book that’s being sold for that much.

Ridiculous as the price tag of this book may be – believe us, there’s nothing justifiable about a book that costs more than an actual car – those interested in it do have options to choose from.

The 852-page book weighs in at 82 lbs and is printed using heavy-duty paper. It’s got over 2,000 photos of every Ferrari vehicle that Maranello has ever produced, be it a road car or a race car. On top of that, the book contains over 200,000 words detailing literally everything and anything you need to know about the Italian automaker.
