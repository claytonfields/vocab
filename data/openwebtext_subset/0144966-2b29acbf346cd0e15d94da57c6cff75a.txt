I saw this pokemon meme going around and I tough it would be fun to try, the hardest part was trying to come with a good idea no one had already tried, and this is what I ended up doing.

This are MAROWAK variations, thinking on what would happen if marowak used different pokemon skulls instead of the one he always carries.

My gf came with the idea of this marowaks having adopting families, being raised by pokemon mothers/fathers that were not his same specie and using their skulls when they died.

I wanted to use many skulls but this 4 are the ones that looked better to me, or more interesting anyway:

1. Tyrantrum’s skull and Femur, with feather’s cape

2. Tauros’ skull and Jaw, with fur’s cape

3. Seviper’s skull and Tail

4. Rampardos’ skull and Femur

Maybe some day I will make more, they are fun to do, but this is all for now, hope you like it
