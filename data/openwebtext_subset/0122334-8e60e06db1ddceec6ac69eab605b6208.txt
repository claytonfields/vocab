Software that is intended to damage or disable computers and computer systems."

By this logic, the GregTech code added was in fact malware as it aimed to disable minecraft as long as TConstruct was installed.

Let me clarify my position though, as I have normally been a strong defender of GregTech as it is forced on no-one.

While I do believe that this was Malware, I also believe that mistakes happen and people sometimes make poor judgement.

Further, I also believe that people should take responsibility for their actions.

All this said, I am not sure what I think of this whole situation, as with any dispute, it could have probably been handled better on both sides, but hindsight is always... (you know).

I guess I will simply monitor moving forward, and most likely GregTech will appear back on my server every now and then.
