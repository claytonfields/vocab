Boris Johnson has been given a £1,000 poetry prize for a rude poem he wrote about the president of Turkey having sex with a goat.

The former London mayor won top prize in a competition run by The Spectator, the magazine he used to edit.

Competition entrants were asked to compose some verse about Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the Turkish president controversially persuaded Angela Merkel to order an investigation of a German comedian who broadcast a dirty ditty about him.

Tory MP Mr Johnson - whose great-grandfather was Turkish - has been highly critical of what he called "an outrageous infringement of free speech”.

Mr Johnson was challenged to come up with an entry for the contest during an interview for the Swiss weekly Die Weltwoche, and devised a limerick that referenced the original's theme of sexual relations with goats.

He wrote: “There was a young fellow from Ankara, Who was a terrific w**kerer,

“Till he sowed his wild oats, With the help of a goat,

“But he didn't even stop to thankera.”

He told the magazine: "If somebody wants to make a joke about the love that flowers between the Turkish president and a goat, he should be able to do so, in any European country, including Turkey.”

Mr Johnson was said to be surprised that the poem had been formally entered to the contest.
