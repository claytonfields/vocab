On June 2, a end-of-year party at Wheeling Park's swimming pool turned tragic when a student was found lifeless under water. Luckily, the lifeguard on duty, the school resource officer and a bus driver sprung into action and saved that child's life.

The three heroes were honored on Monday by the Wheeling Police Department. Sergeant John Schultz, Ed Nowatkoski and Jessica Waterhouse were presented with a lifesaving award by Chief Shawn Schwertfeger at a reception.

Chief Schwertfeger said it was the training and teamwork of the individuals that saved the boy's life.

"Seeing that child in distress and we just quickly went and got him. Great co-worker were able to jump in and help assist to save that little boys life makes it all worth it," Sergeant John Schultz with the Wheeling Police Department said.

Thanks to the quick action, the boy was able to make a complete recovery.
