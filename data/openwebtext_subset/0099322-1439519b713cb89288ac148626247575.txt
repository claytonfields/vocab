At this point, the journey that Mighty No. 9 has taken to development has become almost comical. After a record breaking Kickstarter, hype was at an all-time high, but things quickly began to deflate after numerous delays and an attempt at doing a second fundraising campaign. The development team has remained worryingly quiet as of late, and the 'Spring 2016' window looks increasingly more unlikely with each passing day.

If a store listing at EB Games is to be believed, then it seems the game has been pushed back again. A fan recently snapped a picture of a store display, which puts the game down for a Summer 2016 release. While it's not been confirmed by the development studio yet, retailers occasionally have access to release data that's not yet public knowledge, so there's a chance that it has, in fact, been delayed once again. At this rate, perhaps we can finally expect to see the game release for the NX's successor sometime in 2022.
