Be Smart and Mirror What Works

Up until now, this information has been very difficult to come by in list form.

We’re now offering a service which reveals this information (and more). All you have to do is tell us the name of the music release or event you’d like us to explore, and within 24 hours, we’ll send you a link to a password protected page that gives you the option to view and download your press list as an Excel or PDF file.
