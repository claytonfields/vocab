A dog that has no neck and a short spine has become an internet sensation after her owners created a Facebook page.

Pig, a female mixed-breed dog from Alabama, has short spine syndrome, an illness that means her limbs are normal-sized, but she she appears as though she has been chopped in half.

And although Pig walks like a gorilla, jumps like a frog, looks left and right like an owl, and even topples over like a toddler – she bears little resemblance to her namesake.

Her Facebook page, entitled Pig the Unusual Dog, has more than 29,000 fans and chronicles her adventures with pictures and videos.

Pig’s owner Kim Dillenbeck said she found the eight-month-old as a puppy, abandoned in a forest.

‘She’s missing probably seven inches of spine, her hips and her joints are way up high at the base of her spine, and none of them are in the right position,’ she told Sky News.

Local vet Dr Rachael Hudson-Breland says the unusual mutt is popular with everyone in the area.

‘The whole clinic loves her,’ she said.

‘She comes in and she’s a rock star here.’
