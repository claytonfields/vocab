On Sunday, Obama said that Clinton's situation was different from that of people who had intentionally taken classified material, placed it on a private computer and been prosecuted by federal authorities.

"We don't get an impression that here there was purposely efforts ... to hide something or to squirrel away information," he said.

While it is "important for her" to answer questions about the controversy "to the satisfaction of the American public," Obama said, the issue has been "ginned up" by the campaign season.

Obama's comments come as news of the controversy lingers through Clinton's presidential campaign. In September, the Pentagon said it had discovered previously undisclosed messages between Clinton and then-U.S. commander David Petraeus.

Now, a former congressional investigator is claiming a House committee examining the Benghazi, Libya, attack conducted a biased investigation of Clinton — who was secretary of state during the attack — after news of her email server broke.
