The post, which has been liked and shared more than 4,000 times, sparked major debate among the hundreds of comments.

Many attacked Brown for leaving the woman stranded in the snow based solely on her political stance.

Others defended Brown, saying they would have done the same.

Brown, who posts extensively about political issues, doubled down on his decision, adding 'a list of people Trump voters can call for help:1. Yo president 2. Exxon Mobil CEO 3. General Flynn's son 4. The gunman at Comet pizza in D.C.'

The motorist wrote that he does not support 'Trump supporters, rapists, trafficking, or murderers.

'I believe in peace and harmony. Trump didn't display that.'

Brown revealed that he had been a Bernie Sanders supporter before Donald Trump won the election.

He had posted the picture of the stranded motorist on December 13 - when Ohio was suffering heavy snowstorms and freezing temperatures hitting as low as 13 degrees.
