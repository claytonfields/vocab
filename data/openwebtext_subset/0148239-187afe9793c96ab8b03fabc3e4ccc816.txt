New Rise Of The Tomb: 20 Year Celebration Edition screens have just been released at Gamescom and gives us a much better look at what Classic Lara will look like. I remember reading about it when the PS4 version was revealed, but I didn’t expect her to look this hilarious, it’s actually great.

You’re able to unlock this classic skin pack by completing the game, which will allow you to receive a classic Lara card pack and enable you to replay the game with five classic Lara models from games over the years, including the original Lara model that started it all.

Rise of the Tomb Raider: 20 Year Celebration will include all previously released DLC will be included, including the three hour story addition Baba Yaga: The Temple of the Witch, Cold Darkness Awakened in which players must combat waves of infected predators, 12 DLC outfits, 7 DLC weapons, over 35 Expedition Cards, and more.
