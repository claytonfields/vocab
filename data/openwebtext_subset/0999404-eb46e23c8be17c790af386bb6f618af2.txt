Feel the rhythm, feel the ride, c’mon man its bobsled time! Cool runnings!

Jamaica’s two-man bobsled team of Winston Watts and Marvin Dixon qualified for the 2014 Olympics in Sochi. It’s the first time a Jamaican bobsled team has qualified for the Winter Olympics since 2002.

An entire generation is familiar with the Jamaican bobsled team after Cool Runnings. The Disney movie told the somewhat fictionalized story of how the Caribbean country defied the odds to qualify in the four-man bobsled for the 1988 Olympics in Calgary.

Qualifying for the 2014 Olympics was the easy task for the two-man team of Dixon and Watts. Heading into St. Moritz, they only needed to avoid disaster in order to earn their spot in Russia. The hard part will be getting to the games.

Watts told Chadband the financial hardship the team is under at the moment:

In truth, we still don’t really know at the moment if we’d even have enough funds or sponsorship to fly to Sochi itself for the Games itself. It all depends. Our families need to be taken care of first. If there’s no funding, who knows? But, I’m one of life’s optimists. I put my heart on the line for this. Any British companies out there interested in sponsorin’ us? Hopefully, the Jamaican Olympic Association will step in and support us now we’ve qualified.

Now that the Jamaicans have officially qualified, financial benefactors may come out of the woodwork after hearing of Watts’ story. Perhaps the Jamaican Olympic Association will pony up some dough, too.
