Good guacamole does not need peas. (Deb Lindsey/The Washington Post)

An outrageous proposition was lodged Wednesday: Put peas in guacamole, exhorted the New York Times.

Nope. That's how you feel, right? It's a very easy position to take, if you ask me, and it's one your elected representatives and political parties -- Democrats and Republicans -- are only so happy to adopt as their own. No poll-testing needed here.

Yes, a bunch of politicians and parties gave their takes on something as dumb as ruining perfectly good guacamole with the addition of peas. It's like the blue-or-white-dress question of foods.

Here's a recap of their positions, because this is important.

President Barack Obama: NOPE.

Dang, people are passionate about guac. It seems this green mush of the gods, as I have predicted in the past, could very well unite this nation.
