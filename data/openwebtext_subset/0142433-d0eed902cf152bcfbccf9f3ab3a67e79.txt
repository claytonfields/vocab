Kurt is the most amazing dude you shall ever meet! He is like WAY uber talented. This dude can make amazing music on like any instrument. He has like really and i mean REALLY blue eyes and awesome brown hair. He is REALLY gorgeous inside AND out. He is smart, but is really silly. He can make anyone laugh. Even if you are sitting there trying so hard not to laugh, he will say something random and you will be forced to laugh. He is insanely charismatic, epic beyond all standards, and very lovable. If you don't love him then you just are not a generally nice nor happy person. This Kurt loves family guy and south park, so he loves to laugh. He makes the worst situations great, and the best situations even better than they were to begin with. If you haven't met him yet, i suggest you try to find him. If you have, don't lose whatever relation you have with him. And if you left him, then you are beyond being an idiot. SO yeah... he is simply amazing END OF STORY ! :)
