DAY6’s agency JYP Entertainment has set a strict ticket sales policy in order to eliminate illegal and fraudulent ticket sales to the group’s upcoming concerts.

On July 24, the agency stated that while monitoring the pre-sale, they discovered illegal purchasing activity through a macro automation program. JYP announced certain seat numbers that were purchased illegally and added that the tickets associated with these seats would be canceled altogether.

They added, “To prevent further illegal sales of the canceled seats, we will not be proceeding with a resale [for these seats]. Please be careful not to purchase tickets through illegal sites or scalpers.” Through DAY6’s social media accounts, they also shared the full list of affected seats.

JYP Entertainment continued on to say that since fans are able to purchase two tickets per person on the website Yes24, as outlined in a notice from the agency, the company is not responsible for the any tickets that were purchased through illegal websites or proxy services.

This instance has been noted as an age-old problem in the entertainment industry.

Instances where scalpers utilize a macro program to acquire the good seats and resell them at higher prices are particularly common. Macro programs automatically implement various commands through just one click of the mouse or keyboard.

Since Korea has no clear-cut regulations against macro programs, scalpers are easily able to prey on the sale of idol performances. Currently, efforts are being made to restrict the purchase of tickets through these type of programs.
