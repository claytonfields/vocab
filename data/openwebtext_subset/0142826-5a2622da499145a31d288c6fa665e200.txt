Next year, Andrew W.K. will release his first new album since 2009. Today, he’s revealed the record’s title: You’re Not Alone. It arrives March 2 via RED/Sony. W.K. has also shared the tracklist and cover art, which was painted by Boris Vallejo and Julie Bell. Check those out below, and watch W.K., Vallejo, and Bell discuss the painting here. This past September, W.K. said of the album: “I’m going for the sound of pure, unadulterated power; every emotion, every thought, every experience, every sensation, every fear, every joy, every clarity, every confusion, every up, every down... all extruded and concentrated into one thick syrup of super life-force feeling, and then psychically amplified by the celebratory spirit of glorious partying.”
