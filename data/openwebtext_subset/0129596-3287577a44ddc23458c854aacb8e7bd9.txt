NRA Gun Club (Gun Club in Italy) is described as a nonviolent first-person target shooting game by Crave Entertainment in North America and 505 Games only in Italy (Although a German release was planned, but cancelled for unknown reasons).[1] The game allows gamers to enter the shooting range and shoot at paper targets, watermelons and sporting clays. The game contains over 100 licensed and recreated firearms.

The game generally has very poor ratings and reviews. It was rated by GameSpot 1.6 out of 10 (abysmal) as one of the worst games ever made for the PlayStation 2. Another gaming site, IGN, gave the game a 1.5 out of 10 ("abysmal") and called the game, "a bold move in exploring new depths of sheer worthlessness."[1] The game was rated E10+ (for everyone 10 years of age or older) for mild violence by the Entertainment Software Rating Board.[2]
