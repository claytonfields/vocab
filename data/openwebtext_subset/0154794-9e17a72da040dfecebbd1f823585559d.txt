Rated 5 out of 5 by Ellendy from Awesome--Not Just for Spirits! I have been wanting to get an ice ball press ever since I discovered them last summer. I watched the video on the WS website and was smitten. Then, we dined at a fine restaurant, where they used one, and my fate was sealed. I will be using this every day for my sparkling water. I make it at home with our own pure, reverse osmosis water, but ice cubes usually take the fizz away too fast. I made my first ice ball, and voila, my glass has stayed fizzy all afternoon! Of course, the ice balls would be great for cocktails and for other soft drinks, but I am mainly using mine for water at the moment. The unit is very heavy and very well made. It comes packed in a massive protective case. I bought the 2" one, and I am sure the larger would would be awesome as well! I am also very pleased to see that this product is made in the US!

Rated 5 out of 5 by PurdueFoodie from Love Love Love the Cirrus Ice Ball Press Kit My family and I first saw the Cirrus Ice Ball Press while in Disneyland and the manager of the restaurant was showing the whole lounge area how they made these perfectly round beautiful clear ice balls they serve in their specialty drinks. They were so eye catching; we continued to order the specialty cocktails just to get the ice ball! The best thing about this product is it doesn't water down your drink because the ice ball lasts for hours. The manager let us know that it was Cirrus Ice Ball Press and as soon as we returned to Indiana we ordered one! We purchased the larger ice ball maker kit and it was such a hit at our home and with our guests. This product is a must at a party. We have since ordered 2 more of the small kits as gifts! They are perfect for the person who seems to have everything! The Cirrus Company has outdone themselves with their unique product. It is simple to use, easy to clean, and makes a drink classy. I would recommend this product to anyone.
