Wednesday Writing Hook Sure Hump-Day can suck, but we’ve decided to turn it into a *Hooray-Day* by releasing a new writing hook every week! Each edition will feature an image of an artefact, a complementary writing hook, and a little about its historical provenance, with a further reading option. We’d love to hear about the stories and adventures you wrote with them – be sure to detail them in the comments below! You can subscribe for more writing hooks, or find them on Facebook or Twitter.

The Writing Hook

A pregnant woman has disappeared. The villagers mutter nervously and exchange dark looks – such disappearances have been going on regularly for the last 20 years, not to mention livestock rippings and other attacks. No one has ever been implicated.

A blood-trail leads back to the house of wealthy, pleasant local farmer, Peter Stummp, but there is no obvious evidence in the property. When questioned, neither Stummp nor his daughter seem to know anything, although you do notice that the kitchen is filled with the tantalising aroma of meat stock…

The Historical Facts

Peter Stummp, during 1589, had one of the most famous werewolf trials in history. As he was brutally tortured, he confessed to having practiced black magic since the age of 12, and that the Devil had given him a magical belt, which turned him into a great wolf until he removed it. He also confessed to killing and eating fourteen children, one of whom was his son, and two pregnant women. He later described the fetus hearts as “dainty morsels”, which he plucked out and ate whilst they were still beating. He was accused of incest with his daughter, and also confessed that he had intercourse with a succubus sent to him by the Devil.
