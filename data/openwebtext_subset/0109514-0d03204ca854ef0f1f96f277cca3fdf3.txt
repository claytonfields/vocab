I don't agree with that," he was reported as saying in the Irish Independent.

"I think that it is perfectly in order for so many Irish people in Australia to have an enjoyable celebration of St Patrick's Day and St Patrick's week, and to do so in a thoroughly responsible fashion.

I think it's really important that we understand that we have a national day that can be celebrated worldwide, St Patrick's Day." Defence Minister Kevin Andrews also drew a link between St Patrick's Day and alcohol consumption, tweeting a picture of himself holding a can of Guinness. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop was asked about Mr Kenny's comments and whether Australia had received a complaint from the Irish ambassador on the video message.

Ms Bishop said: "I have not had the Irish ambassador complain about a conspicuous consumption of alcohol."
