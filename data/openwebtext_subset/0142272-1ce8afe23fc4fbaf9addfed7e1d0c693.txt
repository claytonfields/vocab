Tekken 7 is already a lost cause, there's no chance since SFV and probably Revelator will already be out on console before the west will be able to play T7 BR whenever it comes out.

I wouldn't say that high a percentage as over a quarter of the cast is completely new. I wouldn't be that pessmistic as TTT2 was released on consoles a year after its official release in arcades. If T7 follows this trend, then it should be released at the same time as SFV.Then there is the tradition of Capcom releasing absurd numbers of versions of their SF titles. Do we know how many Editions or versions of SFIV or SFII there were? I get the feeling there will be many versions and revisions of SFV when it gets released in March.Do we want the console version of T7 to go through the same number of revisions or editions as SFIV?Guilty Gear Xrd Revelator? Has the game even been officially released in arcades or is it still only at location tests?The US is already playing T7 at tournaments, location tests at Round 1 and at Evo this year.
