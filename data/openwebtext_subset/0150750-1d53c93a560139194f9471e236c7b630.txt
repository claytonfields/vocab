General

They had a lot fun at Gamescom & the meetup

FC points to Aurum conversion ends soon (On the 4th) Details

The legacy transfer ends then as well

IF you used the legacy transfer up to then, you will get a second transfer window later the month Details

The second transfer round will only be for cosmetics

They integrated SWL with Twitch and you can buy Aurum from every SWL streamer

The Streamer gets a small cut from that purchase, there is no cost advantage buying through Twitch but you are supporting the streamer

More Twitch things might come depending on how this goes

Only a very small percentage of players reached 50 yet

They showed off community things, contest entries and Gamescom photos

Upcoming Patch next Week

Date will be announced next Week but they are aiming for Wednesday

It will be an Endgame focused Update

Manhattan Exclusion Zone (The NY Lurker Raid) will in it

Lair Megabosses will be in

There also will be another new Cache and the infernal Cache will no longer be dropping (but still can be opened)

NY Lurker Raid

If you never played TSW, you still know the Lurker from the tutorial, now you will be able to kick his butt

There will be a Story mode version of the raid to get an idea of what is going on

Elite difficulties will be in as well

Elite Version will start directly at the boss, no trash mobs before it

The Raid is tested on the Test servers right now

Rewards will be special (new, not from TSW) outfits, pets, new extraordinary items, distillates for gear XP

They teased about the blade weapon

Lair Megabosses

Lairs are the way to get Signets into the Economy

You do (daily) quests to summon bosses

These can drop the regional boss keys and the regional can drop megaboss keys

The summoner with the key makes a group and that group can summon the boss in Agartha

Everyone in the cabal of the summoner will get an invitation to the fight

After that the people on the platform in Agartha after that as well

The fight is balanced for 40 people and the portal will close when the instance is full

You will be able to see the open portal in Agartha when a summoning is happening

Signets will be the main reward

The group of the summoner will get an automatic rewards

Everyone gets a chest (lair key needed) to open up (that means the summoner group can get 2 rewards)

New Cache

Outfit rewards will be split into small pieces

There is a chance to get a piece of it with every opening of a Cache

The new extraordinary items will come with a new proc

The outfit will no longer have a rising chance of being dropped, the weapons will get that instead now

It is not planed to bring back older Caches (but they might at some point decide to revisit that decision)

You will be able to get an alternate (recolored) version of the outfit for 3rd Age fragments

FutureTech & Cyberpunk is the theme of the Cache and inspired the rewards

Roadmap

They are working on a new version of the build manager and it is coming along well, will need more work & testing through

Continuation of the Tokyo Story will come soon, including a few missing missions, like one of Kurt's

Emote Window (same patch as Tokyo 2 aka Tokyo beyond the wall)

They still want to PvP updates but for now, it is not a priority

The also are working on the final part of Tokyo

The ultimates might change a bit too, more details later

Season 2 is worked on now too, they are very excited about it

Emote Window

You can see all the emotes in a Window

you can see where you can get an emote from

You can launch the emote from there

It still displays the chat command for the emote

Item based emotes (like the Nassier dance, the Sherlock pipe, drinks...) will go there too

They want to add more emotes, either to buy or through achievements

They have more plans with that for the future like idle states, but those will come later (no details now)

The stream today was hosted by the holy trinity of Synosaurus, Andy and Tilty once more.You can re-watch the stream on Twitch If I have missed anything in this info packed stream, please let me know.
