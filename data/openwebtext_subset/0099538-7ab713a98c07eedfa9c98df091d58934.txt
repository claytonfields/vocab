In statements at a panel in the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday Iran Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said US president-elect, Donald Trump, "will be surprised" if he tries to renegotiate the hard-won nuclear deal.

The top diplomat noted that he's taking a "wait and see" attitude about the Trump administration and "the jury is out."

Pressed by the Associated Press afterward on Wednesday, Zarif said it "won't be the end of the world if he [Trump] tries to walk away from the deal [officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action]".

"He wants to surprise people, so he will be surprised," if he does, Zarif said with a smile, without elaborating. Zarif also criticized the outgoing administration of Barack Obama, saying it "did not implement their side of the bargain in a full and complete way" notably about difficulties faced by Iranian banks.

In addition, he told the panel that Iran and Saudi Arabia should be able to work together to help end conflicts in Syria and Yemen, after successfully cooperating over Lebanon last year, Reuters reported.

"I do not see any reason why Iran and Saudi Arabia should have hostile policies toward each other. We can in fact work together to put an end to miserable conditions of the people in Syria and Yemen and Bahrain and elsewhere in the region," Zarif said.

"Iran and Saudi Arabia were able to actually stop impeding the process of the presidential election in Lebanon. We have a success story."
