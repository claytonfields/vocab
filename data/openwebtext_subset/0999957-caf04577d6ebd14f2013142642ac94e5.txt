John Schnatter, the founder and CEO of nationwide pizza chain Papa John's, traveled to Tennessee this past weekend to attend the funeral of an employee who had been shot and killed during a store robbery.Gordon Schaffer, 22, was working the late shift at the Papa John's location in Columbia, Tennessee on October 21 when armed robbers entered the restaurant and ordered Schaffer to empty the cash register. Schaffer complied, but was shot by one of the suspects, and died before medics could transport him to a hospital.Schaffer's funeral was held on October 25 in Spring Hill, Tennessee, and was attended by family and friends with the Papa John's CEO making an unexpected appearance."We never once imagined that this would touch anyone high up in the Papa John's corporate office, let alone, John Schnatter. He was visibly distraught when speaking to my family about the tragic loss of my brother and it was apparent that he didn't come just to pay lip service," Devan Cronin, Schaffer's oldest sister, wrote on Facebook.Papa John's also covered the expenses of Schaffer's funeral and medical costs. Darious A. Fitzpatrick was arrested on Wednesday for killing Schaffer, and also faces charges related to the robberies of two Dollar General stores earlier in October, according to News 2 ABC Nashville.
