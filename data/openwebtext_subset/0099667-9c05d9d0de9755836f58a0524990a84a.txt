Sometimes I fall into a rut with Italian sausages and go with the usual sausage with onion and peppers. Not that there's anything wrong with that but I needed a change! And that is what led me to developing this recipe. I braised the sausages in red wine until the wine completely evaporated and started to crisp up the skin. The sausages take on the deep color of the wine and are then simmered in a spicy tomato, olive and caper sauce. Was it good? Nope ... it was mouth-watering! The Hub, had seconds and he's my "this stuff is good" barometer ... if he's having seconds I know it's a home run.Serves 41 pound Italian sausage1 cup red wine2 tablespoons olive oil1 medium onion, chopped6 garlic cloves, minced or pressed through a press1/4 cup of drained non-pareil capers, roughly chopped1/2 cup of drained kalamata olives, pitted and roughly chopped1 tablespoon tomato paste2 pounds of roma tomatoes, diced or 1- 28 ounce can of diced tomatoes, including juice1 teaspoon fresh or 1/2 dried thymeI bay leaf2 pinches of sugar1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes or to taste (If you don't like heat just leave it out)1 teaspoon salt (or to taste)1/4 teaspoon black pepper1 pound linguine or pasta of choiceIn a deep skillet add the wine and bring to a boil over medium heat.
