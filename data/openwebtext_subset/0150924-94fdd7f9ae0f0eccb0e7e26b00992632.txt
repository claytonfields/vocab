Three IDF soldiers belonging to the Nahal Haredi battalion shot and killed a camel in the Jordan Rift Valley Friday following a dispute with a local Bedouin.

The Bedouin said the soldiers were trespassing through his property. A formal complaint was handed over to the IDF through the Civil Administration.

The three soldiers involved in the incident left their base without permission around 6 pm Friday in order to tour the area. They passed by a local Bedouin resident and entered his tent.

Following an argument that lasted several minutes, the soldiers left the tent, but one of them kneeled down and fired at the camel.

The Bedouin immediately phoned Civil Administration officials and reported the incident. The Administration's representatives, accompanied by Nature Reserve Authority members, rushed to the area and attempted to save the camel's life. However, it was gravely hurt and died at the site.

Army to deal with 'grave incident'

A report on the incident was relayed to the Nahal Brigade, to the Kfir Division, and to the Military Police. The Civil Administration's chief, Brigadier General Yoav Mordechai, spoke with senior Palestinian officials in the Jericho area and pledged to look into and deal with the incident.

Military officials said the incident was grave and will be dealt with through disciplinary action.
