Until 1961, the Club Song was an adaptation of "Spring time in the Rockies" by American country star Gene Autry.

There was a sense within the Club that we needed a more robust song. A song that could provide this was identified as the Notre Dame Victory March. This song had been written in 1905 by alumni of Notre Dame, the Shea brothers.

After a protracted process involving the University and various musical houses, the Club was granted copyright in March 1961 and it became our much loved Club Song:



Cheer, cheer the red and the white,

Honour the name by day and by night,

Lift that noble banner high,

Shake down the thunder from the sky

What though the odds be great or small*,

Swans will go in and win over all

While her loyal sons are marching

Onwards to victory!



*This line over time has been adapted and is often sung as 'Whether the odds be great or small'.
