VICTORIA — If British Columbians are suddenly struck with an overwhelming need to eat brains, the province has cobbled together advice on how the living can fend off the zombies.

The B.C. government is hoping its fictional advice will generate interest in a set of social media tools that aim to help the public in real emergencies.

A blog tapping into the popular horror genre was launched this week on the Emergency Info BC website, and it’s penned from the perspective of a citizen who finds her town infected with a strange virus.

She says she’s able to remain “cool, calm and collected” by reading the government’s emergency Twitter feed and blog.

The campaign is meant to get the public watching for real alerts and updates using the online tools, including Amber Alerts, earthquakes, avalanches, wildfires, floods and tsunamis.

All such disasters are indeed potential threats to the province, with the campaign launched during Emergency Preparedness Week to inform people on how to survive in almost any emergency situation.
