Raheem Sterling was allegedly attacked and racially abused as he arrived at Manchester City’s training ground on Saturday morning in preparation for their game against Tottenham Hotspur.

The England forward was believed to have been kicked and branded a “n-----” by a man who appeared to be waiting for the 23-year-old at the players’ entrance at City’s football academy training base, according to sources.

Sterling had pulled into the entrance in his car as he arrived for City’s pre-match preparations, at which point he is believed to have been confronted by the man hurling a barrage of abuse at him.

Telegraph Sport understands that Sterling got out of his car to ask what the problem was only for the man to react by reputedly kicking the City player in the leg.

It is unclear at this stage whether City have opted to report the incident to Greater Manchester Police but it is thought the sickening scenes were caught on CCTV. It is not believed the man was known to Sterling. City have yet to comment on the matter.

Sterling did not suffer any injuries in the alleged attack and he went on to start and score twice – his 14th and 15th goals of an extraordinary season – in City’s 4-1 victory over Tottenham as Pep Guardiola’s side moved 14 points clear at the top of the Premier League.
