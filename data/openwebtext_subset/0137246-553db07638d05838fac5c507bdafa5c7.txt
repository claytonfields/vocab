We first talked about this back in February. But now it’s finally on paper. Andy Diggle and Mark Buckingham’s Doctor Who, scheduled with a new issue 1 for September from IDW. And one of the covers appears to be a make-your-own-TARDIS model. But who would cut up their comic to do such a thing?

Naturally there’s the Star Trek Next Gen/Doctor Who crossover going on

STAR TREK TNG DOCTOR WHO ASSIMILATION #5 IDEA & DESIGN WORKS LLC (W) David Tipton & Various (A/CA) J. K. Woodward The two greatest science-fiction properties of all time cross over for the first time in history, in STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION/DOCTOR WHO: ASSIMILATION2! Captain Jean-Luc Picard faces one of the most difficult decisions of his life, but the fate of the galaxy may depend on it! Can the Doctor convince him to make the correct choice?

Probably, yes. And finally an IDW Star Trek: The Next Generation series too. Generation Hive. Oh look, there’s Borg. Locutus. Seven Of Nine. And the Queen. And they’ve got Next Gen’s Brannon Braga to write it…

In the distant future the entire galaxy has been completely assimilated by Borg and it’s king… Locutis! The only hope for the future lies in the past, in the hands of Captain Jean-Luc Picard and the crew of the starship Enterprise-as Picard faces off against the Borg collective in one final, terrifying and definitive encounter!

Brannon Braga is one of the writers most associated with the Star Trek Franchise. He has written a number of fondly remembered episodes of TNG, including co-writing the two-part series finale, “All Good Things…,” for which he won the prestigious Hugo Award. Terry Matalas has written for Star Trek: Enterprise, as well as Terra Nova.
