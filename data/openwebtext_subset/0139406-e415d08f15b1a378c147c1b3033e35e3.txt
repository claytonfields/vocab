Despite the comic shown above, my friends (who are actually a bunch of really good people and not a grey-faced evil hive-mind) have yet to try to rope me back in to their return to WoW. If they did ask me back, or try to coax me, I wouldn’t just shout “fuck off” and blast them away with whatever that is. That would just be rude.

Don’t get me wrong, I had a really good time back in my WoW days. I have a ton of fond memories and good stories from back then, but it’s just not the same world to return to anymore. I’ve moved on. To those that still tread that ground, and wage war on those battlefields, good on ya. I look forward to hearing your new legends someday.
