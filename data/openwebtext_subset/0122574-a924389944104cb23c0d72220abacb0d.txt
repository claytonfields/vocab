Was the Godfather pleasantly surprised that someone saw the light after waking up with a horse head in his bed? Don’t think so.

But for some reason, CNN host Alisyn Camerota expressed surprise and delight that the guy who created the video of Donald Trump taking down someone with the CNN logo superimposed on his face has apologized — after CNN unmasked him and tracked him down.

As our Mike Lachance has reported, CNN tracked down the clip creator and threatened to dox him—to expose his identity and location—if he backed off his apology.

CNN and other media are pushing the line that if was proper to unmask the guy because he also had racist and anti-Semitic anonymous posts. But that’s not why CNN did this. CNN tracked the guy down because he creating a GIF mocking CNN, that then was used by CNN’s arch enemy, Trump.

Camerota is either extremely naive—or extremely cynical. Co-host Chris Cuomo wasn’t so wide-eyed, telling Camerota “when exposed, and identified, he then decided to apologize.”

But Camerota wouldn’t quit her Pollyanna impersonation, saying that she saw the apology as a possible “glimmer of hope.”
