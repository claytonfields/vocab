Self-styled "peace activist" Danny Lim - a cardboard-carrying identity on the streets of Sydney - has been fined for offensive behaviour after brandishing a sign targeting Prime Minister Tony Abbott.

Police confirmed Mr Lim had been issued with an infringement notice and was also ordered to "move on" from outside Edgecliff Station on Monday morning.

"He was also told he could return to the space he was occupying without his offensive sign," a NSW Police spokeswoman said. The $500 fine for offensive conduct was increased from $200 last year.

A former Strathfield councillor, the 71-year-old Mr Lim is known for toting large billboards strapped to his body, bearing messages of peace and love. In recent years his preaching has become more overtly political, including the pun: "People can change, Tony you c**t."
