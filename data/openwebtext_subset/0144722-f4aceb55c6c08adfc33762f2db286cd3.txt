Hamilton Tiger-Cat receiver Bakari Grant has always played the game of football with something resembling barely controlled fury, his emotions pouring out after every tough catch or touchdown grab.

It would have seemed impossible to motivate him any further.

The Ticats unwittingly found a way. They weren't willing to pay Grant top dollar when he was a free agent this winter. Sure, they wanted him back but at a team-friendly price, not in the pay band of top-tier guys like Montreal's S.J. Green or Saskatchewan's Weston Dressler.

He grudgingly signed a one-year deal in March — more than a month after free agency opened — and has spent the first six weeks of the season putting up big numbers.

"I think Bakari is on mission," says quarterback Zach Collaros. "We talked a lot in the off-season, especially when the contract negotiation was going on and I just told him how much I wanted him back."

Loyalty, however, is a rare commodity in football and from a pure numbers standpoint, it's not hard to see the Ticats' argument.

Over his first four seasons, Grant has been a consistent contributor with 207 receptions for 2,535 yards and 12 touchdowns. His best season came in 2013 when he led the team and set career highs in receptions (69) and receiving yards (947) and was named an East Division All-Star.

Still, that works out to a shade under 52 catches, 633 yards and three touchdowns a season. Green — who signed a lucrative contract extension in the off-season — has averaged 68 catches and 1,033 yards over the last five years. Dressler has five 1,000-yard seasons in his seven years in the league. And after four years, it was fair to wonder if Grant had hit his ceiling as a player.

It would appear not.

So far this season, Grant is sixth in the CFL in receiving with 389 yards and has four touchdown catches, good enough for second. He's on pace to set career highs in every statistical category that matters when it comes time to talk contract.
