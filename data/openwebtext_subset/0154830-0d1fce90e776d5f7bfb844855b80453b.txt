OO is successful because many people use it. These people use OO concepts and language to intuitively factor the world and describe a future. They form intentions to make software and communicate their thinking with other people by using OO terms. There is more to making software than typing on a keyboard; that is why OO is successful.

OO is successful based on how it works psychologically . Theoretically, people can solve the same problems with other technologies; we can imagine an alternate universe with some other paradigm being dominant. In practice, for various reasons, people do not use other technologies to nearly the same degree as OO.

To foresee what will work in times to come, it is well to understand why what has worked, did work. Within software engineering, I cannot think of a technology that has had a greater impact on mass consciousness than object-orientation.
