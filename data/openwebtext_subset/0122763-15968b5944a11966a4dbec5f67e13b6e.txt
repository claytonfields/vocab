The Sydney Harbour Bridge is one of Australia’s most recognised landmarks, with its magnificent arch-based design and view of the harbour. But if we travel back to March 19, 1932, the bridge was just opening to Sydneysiders.

Since the 1800s there were proposals for building a bridge between the harbour’s north and south shores, but it wasn’t until 1900 that design submissions were actually invited by the government.

All the design submissions were considered ‘unsuitable’ in 1900, so the bridge was abandoned. However, following the First World War, serious plans started for the Sydney Harbour Bridge.

A general design was put forward by Dr John Bradfield and officers of the New South Wales Department of Public Works. This time the design was accepted and in 1922 the contract for construction was granted to an English firm, Dorman Long and Co. of Middlesbrough, who are still in business today!

Construction of the bridge took eight years. Compared to the four years (and $10bn) it took to complete the 42-kilometre Qingdao Haiwan Bridge in China that may seem a long time but that’s comparing apples and oranges.

The opening day of the bridge also has quite a humorous tale. Before the NSW Premier could cut the ribbon, Captain Francis De Groot, a member of the British Empire-loving The New Guard, went ahead and slashed the ribbon with his sword. He was perhaps Australia’s first hooligan (or pro-royalist, you make the call). The ribbon was tied back up and properly cut by the Premier.

When the bridge first opened in 1932, it saw daily traffic at the 11,000 mark, whereas now it’s skyrocketed to over 160,000 vehicles a day. And to think how we might have to travel to the city centre if the bridge was never constructed – ferries are good, but sea sickness isn’t!

Happy birthday, Sydney Harbour Bridge – you’re looking fine for 82!
