The Google employee who was fired for writing an internal memo criticizing the company’s diversity policies and arguing that women are biologically less suited to work in technology than men has been offered a job… by Wikileaks.

Wikileaks publisher Julian Assange made the job offer to the fired employee, James Damore, via Twitter on Tuesday.

“Censorship is for losers,” Assange wrote. “@Wikileaks is offering a job to fired Google engineer James Damore.”

The job offer comes following Damore’s prompt dismissal after his memo became public over the weekend. According to CNN, Google CEO Sundar Pichai sent an email to Google’s employees denouncing the fired employee’s memo.

“Our job is to build great products for users that make a difference in their lives,” he wrote. “To suggest a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited to that work is offensive and not OK.”
