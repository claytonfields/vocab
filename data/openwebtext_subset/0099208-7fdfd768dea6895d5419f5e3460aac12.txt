The New York Islanders will welcome captain John Tavares back to the lineup for their contest against the Montreal Canadiens, head coach Jack Capuano confirmed.

The 25-year-old has missed the Islanders' last three games with what the team deemed "flu-like symptoms," but after taking an optional skate Thursday, he was inserted into the lineup.

Tavares explained the severity of his illness Thursday, saying it rendered him unable to eat until Monday, when he was then forced to try to put on the weight he lost, according to NHL.com's Arpon Basu.

With Tavares returning to the lineup, forward Steve Bernier will draw out.

Despite missing three games, Tavares leads the club in scoring with five goals and 11 points in 10 games.
