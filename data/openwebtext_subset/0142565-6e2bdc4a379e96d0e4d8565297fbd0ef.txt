Proponents of a $400 million, 68-turbine wind farm at Collector say most of the village residents support the project, which has moved a step closer to approval.

RATCH-Australia is expected to take two years building the region's latest wind farm near the Federal Highway at Collector. It will generate up to 228 megawatts of electricity, or enough energy to power around 80,000 homes annually.

Chief executive Steve Loxton said the 60-day public exhibition period represented the culmination of years of research.

''Our surveys of local Collector residents confirm that there is strong support for renewable energy and we look forward to, indeed encourage, the participation of the community and other stakeholders during the public exhibition period,'' he said.

''We believe our proposal has significant merit, not only through its contribution towards helping meet Australia's renewable energy target, but also through it contribution to the local community and economy through investment, employment and a $200,000 per annum community benefit fund for Collector, which will be established once the wind turbines are operational.''
