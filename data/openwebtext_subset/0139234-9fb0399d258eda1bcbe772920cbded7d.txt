Columbus Crew SC today announced that it has signed two players ahead of the 2016 Major League Soccer regular season: midfielder Marshall Hollingsworth and goalkeeper Matt Pacifici (pronounced: puh-CHIFF-uh-chee). Hollingsworth (41st overall) was a 2016 MLS SuperDraft selection by the Black & Gold; both players participated in the duration of preseason training camp with Crew SC. Further terms of the transactions were not disclosed.

During the Desert Diamond Cup in Tucson, Arizona, Pacifici held Real Salt Lake scoreless over 28 minutes on February 24, while Hollingsworth made two separate appearances for Crew SC throughout the tournament.



“We are pleased to be able to offer contracts to both Marshall and Matt,” said Sporting Director and Head Coach Gregg Berhalter. “Both of them showed their potential throughout our preseason this year. We look forward to working with them, monitoring their development and helping them grow as professionals during their rookie seasons.”



Hollingsworth participated in Crew SC's College Combine at MAPFRE Stadium ahead of his selection by the Black & Gold in the Second Round (41st overall). He made 92 appearances for Wheaton over his four seasons with the Thunder, making 85 starts. He scored 45 goals and added 21 assists for his collegiate career, including a 22-goal season in 2015, which ranked seventh in program history for single-season tallies.

Pacifici played 70 games over his college career with Davidson, notching a 1.45 goals-against average with a 28-31-10 record and 11 clean sheets. He recorded a shutout in his first-ever collegiate start, on August 27, 2012 against Clemson. During his junior season in 2014, he notched a career-best 0.65 goals-against average with seven shutouts en route to being named Second Team All-Conference. A two-year captain, he earned Davidson's Charlie Slagle Coach's Award in 2015 as well as Atlantic 10 All-Academic and Senior CLASS Award First Team honors.
