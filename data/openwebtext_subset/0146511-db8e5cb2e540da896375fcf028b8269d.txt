Paraguay's penalty hero Derlis Gonzalez says a relative suffered a heart attack and died while watching the team defeat Brazil in the Copa America on Saturday night.

Both Gonzalez and his father said Irrazabal Manuel, whom they referred to as Gonzalez's uncle, died while celebrating the victory in his homeland.

Gonzalez scored the final penalty in the 4-3 shootout that lifted Paraguay into the tournament semifinals after the game ended 1-1 after 90 minutes.

The striker's father, Simon Gonzalez, told Ultima Hora that Manuel was "my friend, I consider my brother, my cousin's husband was."

Derlis Gonzalez later confirmed Manuel's death in a post on Twitter, accompanied by a picture of Manuel.
