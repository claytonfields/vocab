Tunji – “Towards The Future (ft. Deacon The Villain)” – [Produced By: Cook Classics] | [DOWNLOAD MP3]

Tunji (Formerly of Inverse) is now on the solo tip and we’ve got his first new single off of his forthcoming Still Rising EP set to drop this Fall.

“Towards The Future” is a celebratory song, about appreciating new beginnings without forgetting the lessons of the past. QN5’s Deacon The Villain provides the track with his patented drawl-tinged crooning, while the always impressive Cook Classics conjures up a misty gust of that cool Cali breeze on the boards. We love it and we know you will too. Yesterday was his birthday, so download the track, bump the track and give this man some belated b-day love.

Enjoy!
