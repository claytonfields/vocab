9. The First Movie - Roundhay Garden Scene

1888 saw the creation of the first strip of celluloid ever shot that survives today: a two second shot of a man walking across a yard while some ladies mill about known as the Roundhay Garden Scene. Even beyond the importance of the strip in cinematic history terms, theres an interesting story regarding the aftermath of shooting this little film, as it was said to have left a cursed legacy that did for its major players. First, the director Louis Le Prince disappeared from a train a few years later (one of the suspects in that case was Le Prince's rival Thomas Edison, who will be featured repeatedly in this list later on,) before, in 1902, the man walking across the shot was shot dead for reasons unrelated to the film, and Le Princes mother-in-law - who also made an appearance in the film - died only ten days after the filming was completed. If theres any truth to this curse, it means that the first bit of film ever shot is much creepier than the first horror movie. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1i40rnpOsA
