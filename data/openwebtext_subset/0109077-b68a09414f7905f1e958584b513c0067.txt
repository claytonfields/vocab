With Seth Rollins injured, the WWE world heavyweight championship vacant, and plenty of intrigue surrounding the start of the tournament to crown a new champion, one might think there would be increased interest in this week's episode of Monday Night Raw.

One would be wrong.

Indeed, this week's show garnered just 3.17 million viewers, down from last week's 3.24 million. That's a new low for a non-holiday show in the three hour era and it's coming dangerously close to being a new low including holidays.

The hourly breakdown is even worse:

Hour one: 3.48 million

Hour two: 3.17 million

Hour three: 2.86 million

That is a shockingly low number for the third and final hour, which featured the return of Undertaker and Kane as the Brothers of Destruction to confront The Wyatt Family. It's the lowest it has ever been, actually. The show aired on tape delay with spoilers available beforehand but last year's Raw in the UK did 3.93 million viewers for all three hours and the third hour was at 3.83 million.

Cord cutting is a very real issue right now but these numbers have fallen off to an alarming degree.
