The Sun reports that the Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call – New Orleans actor only eats meat from animals that mate in a 'dignified' way

Nicolas Cage has reportedly revealed that he will eat only animals who mate in a dignified fashion, a dietary preference which apparently rules out pork. According to the Sun, the Oscar-winning actor is happy to eat fish or poultry because their love lives are more decorous.

"I have a fascination with fish, birds, whales – sentient life – insects, reptiles," says Cage, who is currently getting great reviews for his performance as a drug-addled detective in Werner Herzog's Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call – New Orleans, a quasi-remake of Abel Ferrara's 1992 tale of a destructive cop.

He continues: "I actually choose the way I eat according to the way animals have sex. I think fish are very dignified with sex. So are birds.

"But pigs, not so much. So I don't eat pig meat or things like that. I eat fish and fowl."

Cage, whose glowing Bad Lieutenant notices follow praise for his role in Kick-Ass, is known for having an eccentric fascination with animals. He has a tattoo of a lizard wearing a top hat, has owned a pet octopus and once ate a cockroach for a movie role.

For Bad Lieutenant, which is out in the UK on Friday, he bought a snake with two heads to protect him during filming in New Orleans. The creature was later donated to a zoo.
