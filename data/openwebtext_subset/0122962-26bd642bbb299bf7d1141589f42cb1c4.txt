Shut the fuck up. So lets see. I can now narrow who ever the OP of all these threads and posts down to the very few people I know that have seen me in red jeans that the women went crazy over as I got laid everynight and you all didnt. So lets see. I think ill start making a list so I can shame whatever asshole is obsessed with my pants, my bulge and my sexy self while you sit here online making fun of bands you probably never have even heard before and starting trouble between a friend of mine and myself. Bottom line, Jolly is a friend of mine. We have had many a good time. I like Sire and I even drove them to a Boston show once and wouldnt mind seeing them again. So whoever is using my name and my band name can give it up. The joke is dead. And if anyone in Sore is reading this please dont feed these trolls. They randomly started talking shit about me and pretending to be me as they talked shit about you only problem is they didnt realize we are actually all friends so they failed. I did get pissed off that they tried so hard to piss me off but whatever. And Jolly I hope that you really did make that response but keep in mind these people are retards. I dont get how someone saying they didnt like your band at a churchburn show has or had anything to do with me, gss ron and all the gay xasthur references and etc etc. Seriously people? Lame and beating a dead horse joke. Wow you made fun of a band and then you made fun of me. You are a internet hero. Congrats.
