Just three years removed from his second consecutive All-Star appearance, former Indians' closer Chris Perez has retired from baseball, according to the International League transactions page. Perez was most recently pitching with the Orioles' Triple-A affiliate in Norfolk.

Perez saved 124 games while posting a 3.33 ERA in five seasons in Cleveland after being acquired from the Cardinals in exchange for Mark DeRosa in 2009. He saw major-league time with the Cardinals (2008-2009), Indians (2009-2013) and Dodgers (2014) in a seven-year major-league career, posting a lifetime 3.51 ERA and saving 133 games in 393 relief appearances.

Perez rose to prominence during his time in Cleveland, when he posted a 1.71 ERA in 63 games in 2012 before posting ERAs of 3.32 and 3.59 in his All-Star seasons of 2011 and 2012. He saw time in Triple-A with the Brewers' and Orioles' organizations this season but struggled and will ultimately step away from baseball.
