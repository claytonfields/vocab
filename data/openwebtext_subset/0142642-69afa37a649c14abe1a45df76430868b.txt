Well, this may actually be it. After years of thwarting attempts by the site's landowners to toss Irv's Burgers off the corner of Santa Monica Boulevard and Sweetzer in West Hollywood, Irv's owner Sonia Hong may have to hang up her spatula once and for all. Despite being one of our favorite old school burger stands, Irv's Burgers is slated to shutter at the end of June, according to the site Route 66 News. And the reason, as you might guess, is money.

For nearly a decade now, Hong and her family have fought to keep Irv's alive and cooking -- literally. With her infectiously positive personality and penchant for doodling every customer who ever ordered from her, Hong has become a West Hollywood treasure among everyday eaters and local businesspeople alike. Of course, it helped that her well-griddled double cheeseburgers, brimming with Southern California tradition, have been feeding the neighborhood for generations.

Now that all seems poised to change. Despite winning landmark status back in 2006, Hong has been under near-constant pressure from the folks who own the land underneath her unique burger shack. After attempts in the early 2000's to shuffle off Irv's Burgers in favor of a Peet's Coffee failed, the family that owns the pricey corner lot allegedly returned this year with plans to up the rent to $7000 per month in a bid to scare her off the land. When even that fell through, so the rumors go, Hong was sent a 30-day notice to vacate the premises. Still, she's trying to fight for an extension, and hoping for something much more substantial.
