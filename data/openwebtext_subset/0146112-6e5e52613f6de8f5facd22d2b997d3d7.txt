The ingenious Gentleman Miss Rainbow Dash of Cloudsdale.Crossover of The ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha. Fortune is arranging matters for us better than we suppose to be desired: because you see there, my dear Scootaloo, where thirty, or a little more, incontinent giants with whom intend to do battle and take away all the lives, and with whose spoils we will begin to to flourish. Giants? Those you see there, with the long arms, which some have them nearly two leagues. But your honor, that resemble those there are not giants but windmills, and what seem to be their arms are the sails that turned by the wind make the millstone. Well it seems you're not used to this adventures: they are giants; and if you're scared, get out there and stand in prayer in the space I engage them in fierce and unequal combat. No flee, cowardly and vile creatures, a single knight attacks you. My dear Celestia !. Did not I tell your worship to mind what he was doing, they were only windmills, and I could not ignore it but one who had something kind in his head? Shut up, Scootaloo, things of the war, more than any other are liable to frequent fluctuations; the more, I think, and it is so true that the sage Freston who stole my room and books, has turned these giants into windmills for taking away the glory of vanquishing them, such is the enmity he bears me; but, after all, after all, they have little power their dirty tricks against the goodness of my sword.(Edited from the Chapter 8, from The ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha by Miguel de Cervantes)
