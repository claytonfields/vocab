D2L Season 5 LAN finals to kick off

The highly anticipated D2L season 5 lan finals will kick off tomorrow at Caesars Palace, Las Vegas. Evil Geniuses and Virtus.pro Polar will take on CDEC and LV-Gaming over the course of two days.

Four teams will take on one another in the second LAN finals for the D2L where they will be fighting for their stake in the $50,000 base prize pool. The teams attending have all qualified from their respective regional qualifiers; the winners of the Eastern qualifiers are CDEC and LV Gaming whilst the Western squads are Virtus Pro.Polar and Evil Geniuses. The first game of the lan will be EG vs LV Gaming taking place on January 5th, 02:00 (GMT+1/CET).

Out of the four teams present, only CDEC will be playing without a stand-in. VP.Polar will be playing with Jimmy 'DeMoN' Ho instead of Ilya 'LiL_HaRDy' Ilyuk due to visa issues; EG will be playing with Syed Sumail 'SumaiL' Hassan and Kurtis 'Aui_2000' Ling instead of Ludwig 'Zai' WÃ¥hlberg and Artour 'Arteezy' Babaev, possibly due to an imminent roster change; Chai 'Mushi' Yee Fung and Khoo 'Ohaiyo' Chong Xin will be standing-in for Demons and Lin for that reason as well.
