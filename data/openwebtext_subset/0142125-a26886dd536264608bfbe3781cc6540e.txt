Human and animal skeletal remains were among the many items a 4-year-old Husky uncovered while digging in a Northern California home’s backyard on Monday, KCRA reported.

Renters of the Yuba City home called the local police department after discovering the unusual remains their dog, Skye, had found.

“She never digs in the grass or anything, but that one spot. She just wouldn’t leave it alone,” renter Aaron Kind said.

When Kind approached the dog, he saw a “creepy looking” doll head, a machete, and a ceramic or clay pot.

Later the roommates saw a human skull and what appeared to be a jaw bone.

“It went from kind of cool to kind of serious, so we got the authorities on the line,” Kind said.

The remains may have been part of an Afro-Caribbean religious ritual, experts from California State University, Chico stated after an initial examination.

Investigators continued to try to identify the origin and age of the human remains.
