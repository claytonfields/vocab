I saw Bisu talking about Soulkey on his stream just now while viewing the recent news about SKT1. Apparently, Soulkey was found on PianO's stream a few days ago (can someone look through PianO's stream VODs and confirm this?).



If this is the case, Soulkey could be one of the 5 mystery Zergs confirmed for the upcoming



Can someone with more insider knowledge confirm this? Can someone with access to Afreeca ask either PianO, ZerO or free if they heard anything from their former teammate?

I posted about BravO and Soulkey leaving a week or two ago. I don't know if it's still happening, but the rumours back then said that Soulkey would start streaming on afreeca.

Just nowadays there is a lot more money in other areas rather than just be the #2 or #3 slot on a proleague team and get your salary



anyways, we'll just have to wait on this one





I think that there wasn't an announcement he was searching for other teams might be a bit more telling (quick edit: almost all the other recent team shuffle players immediately announced searching for another team, etc etc. The google translate of the



He was born 1991 so he may be doing a "retire -> spend a few months off -> military" type of deal



ofc, some of the afreeca streamers were following that plan and a "Few months off" is turning into years and years before going to the military :p nah he had a decent year (actually more than decent) as he made at least ro16 all three gsls and performed stabley in proleague. Recent results in proleague is a string of losses on liquipedia though. But SKT got 2nd so by any good measure that is a solid yearJust nowadays there is a lot more money in other areas rather than just be the #2 or #3 slot on a proleague team and get your salaryanyways, we'll just have to wait on this oneI think that there wasn't an announcement he was searching for other teams might be a bit more telling (quick edit: almost all the other recent team shuffle players immediately announced searching for another team, etc etc. The google translate of the dailyesports article of course is not helpful at all and sc2 people havent translated it.

oh wow, knew about Seeker's comment but your comment makes it seem like it's a sure thing. Either way, it's still odd that he left SKT T1 considering that his performance is still really good despite him not being #1 Zerg anymore. It was the biggest surprise of the news when it came to SKT T1 signings/releases. ^ I always got the feeling that SK > ZerO though towards the end of pro BW, ZerO was eclipsing him and becoming the better player. That looks like a game I would lose as the terran haha.oh wow, knew about Seeker's comment but your comment makes it seem like it's a sure thing.

Maybe he's planning on going to the military. Jangbi was Code S before he returned to BW. And his form on SC2 seemed to have declined a bit. Maybe he's planning on going to the military.

WOOT hopes he stays on BW for long and give Killer a run for his money
