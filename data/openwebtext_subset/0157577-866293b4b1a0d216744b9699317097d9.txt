Foxtons is under fire for allegedly charging a landlord £616 for repairing a light fitting in a flat.

Solicitors now claim that the London-based estate agency could find itself in a multi-million pound legal wrangle.

Why? Here’s what happened:

In 2011, King’s College law lecturer Dr Chris Townley employed Foxtons to let his London flat.

In 2013, he was handed a whopping a £616 bill for repairing a light fitting.

When he challenged Foxtons over the bill, the estate agency said that the sub-contractor carried out the repair work.

However, on checking with the subcontractor, Townley found out that the bill for the job was only £412.50 and that Foxtons had added over £200 of extra costs on the bill.

Townley, through his solicitors, is now demanding compensation from Foxtons.

His solicitors claim that Foxtons could have to fork out up to £40m in compensation if it has over-charged other landlords.

Dr Townley told the Daily Telegraph: “When I first heard there was a commission I was not happy, but thought it may be 2 or 3 per cent. When I found out the real amount I thought it was shocking.”

A spokesman for Foxtons said: “We are incredibly disappointed to hear when any customer is dissatisfied with the service they have received, however, as a legal dispute we are not in a position to comment on the specifics of this case.

“We are satisfied though that our fees are clearly laid out within our terms and conditions and that approvals are obtained from our landlords before works commence on their property.”
