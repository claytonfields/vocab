The Trump administration has delayed a major upgrade to the labels on our food.

In 2016, the Obama administration and Food and Drug Administration released a revamp of the standard nutrition label. The changes were designed to emphasize serving sizes, added sugars, and calories, ideally to help Americans make smarter food choices.

Those changes were supposed to happen by July 26, 2018. But in June, the FDA said it would give companies more time to make the shift. In September, the FDA said that it would give large manufacturers until January 1, 2020 to make the changes instead. Smaller companies that make less than $10 million in food sales will have until January 1, 2021.

Nutrition labels have been a constant fixture on packaged food and drinks since 1990, but they've remained pretty much the same since then. Former First Lady Michelle Obama had been pushing for them to be changed since 2014.

Here's how the now-delayed labels will differ from the ones you currently see:
