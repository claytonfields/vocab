Western Australia is the only state set to get a public holiday for Anzac Day next year.

In 2015, Anzac Day falls on a Saturday. The other state government have chosen not to allow a Monday public holiday.

"The purpose of Anzac Day is to respect, commemorate and remember the brave soldiers who sacrificed so much for our freedoms," Victoria's Small Business Minister Russell Northe said.

"It is not about getting a day off and taking for granted the liberties our soldiers fought so bravely to protect."

Mr Northe said Anzac Day trading restrictions would apply no matter which day April 25 fell on.

In 2009, Anzac Day fell on a Saturday and there was no public holiday, but the next year, when April 25 fell on a Sunday, Victorians got a Monday public holiday.
