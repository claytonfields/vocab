Toronto police are trying to identify a woman caught on security camera vandalizing a luxury sedan in the city's west end on the weekend.

Investigators say the Sunday morning incident marked the third time this year that the car's owner has had a vehicle vandalized.

A security video released by police, a woman in a baseball cap with a red bandana over her face is seen running up to a Lincoln MKS in the driveway of a home near Glenholme Ave. and Rogers Rd.

She then scratches the hood and sides of the car extensively with a sharp object.

"Obviously [the car owner] was targeted, because it's only his vehicle that's been damaged on the street," said Det.-Const. Jay Dabu.

Police have not established that the woman in the video is responsible for all three incidents at that address, but Dabu said it is "more than likely" that the car owner and the vandal know each other.

The car owner is scheduled to come to Toronto police 13 Division for the vehicle's damage to be assessed.

"I'm no body shop guy, but it's probably at least a couple of thousand [dollars' worth] if I'm not mistaken," Dabu said.

The woman in the video is described as white, between five-foot-two and five-foot-five, with a thin build and brown hair.
