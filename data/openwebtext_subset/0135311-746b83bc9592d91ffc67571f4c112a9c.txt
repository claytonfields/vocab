× Johnson Controls to close “Milwaukee Business Center,” 277 employees impacted

GLENDALE — The Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development has been notified of the closing of Johnson Controls’ “Milwaukee Business Center” on N. Lydell Avenue.

The closure will impact 277 employees between January 26th and June 30th, 2016.

The Milwaukee Area Workforce Investment Board will provide Rapid response services to the affected workers.

The Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development (DWD) Dislocated Worker Program provides transition assistance to workers and companies affected by permanent worker layoffs. The Program’s local Rapid Response Teams help companies and worker representatives develop and implement a practical transition plan based on the size of the layoff event.

Types of services include:

pre-layoff workshops on a variety of topics such as resume writing and interviewing, job search strategies, and budgeting

provision of information about programs and resources through written materials and information sessions

career and resource fairs.

Workers affected by permanent layoff may also access basic re-employment services at no charge through the state’s Job Centers.

Some services, including training assistance, may be an option for some workers after enrolling in one or more of DWD’s workforce development programs.

While all companies faced with permanent worker layoffs are encouraged to seek assistance from the local Rapid Response Teams, some companies may be required to give 60 days notice before a mass layoff or closing under federal and/or state law.
