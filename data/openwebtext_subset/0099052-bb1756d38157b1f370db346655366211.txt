The world has gone cuckoo for cold brew and let us tell you, we don’t blame them. First a disclaimer: making cold brew is not push-button simple. It takes a long time (12-24 hours, to be exact) and can be a bit of a mess.

Which is why we try to make it easy on y’all with Stubbies, growlers, and cans, oh my. But if you’re a DIY-er, big batch cold brew at home is as delicious as the summer day is long.

We sell the Filtron Cold Brewer online so we are obviously Filtron fans, but we decided to do a round-up of several options on the market and see how it fares against our home team favorite.

For the round-up, we brewed up our House Blend, a great choice for cold brewing, and brewed each method according to the directions in the box. The next day we did a blind taste test to find our favorites.

We looked for things like ease of brewing and clean-up, functionality of brewer and most importantly, the resulting flavor and profile of the brewed coffee.
