The pool party – Remember what momma said: “Don’t swim right after you eat– you’ll cramp up and drown” …and… “Don’t pee in the pool.” The former is a mere old wives’ tale, but seriously, DON’T PEE IN THE POOL. But back to the food. The key to throwing a killer pool party is having a great spread of foods and beverages that won’t perish in the summer heat. Try Thug Kitchen’s Lavender Lemonade plus rum or vodka, and soak it up with something other than chips, crackers, or “meh” fruit salads. Enjoy bacon in the sun while bakin’ in the sun (maybe wrapped around jalapeño poppers or infused into chocolate chip cookies), or pulled pork sliders with sweet and hot pickles, grilled peaches, or a sneaky watermelon cake
