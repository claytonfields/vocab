Fabio Borini: Three goals in 38 appearances for Liverpool

Bologna are interested in signing Liverpool forward Fabio Borini, according to Sky Italia.

The Serie A club have not yet made an official bid for the 24-year-old, but are believed to be working on an offer.

Borini has struggled to make an impact at Anfield since arriving in 2012, and he could now be on his way back to the club at which he began his youth career.

After joining Chelsea’s youth system from the Bologna academy in 2007, the Bentivoglio-born forward had successful loan spells at Swansea and Roma, but he has scored just three goals in 38 appearances for Liverpool since becoming Brendan Rodgers’ first signing at the club.

Bologna, bought by New York lawyer Joe Tacopina and Montreal Impact President Joey Saputo in October, finished fourth in last season’s Serie B before securing promotion back to the top flight through the play-offs.

Borini enjoyed a successful season-long loan at Sunderland in 2013/14, scoring 10 goals, including the opener in their Capital One Cup Final defeat to Man City. This led to a proposed permanent move to the Stadium of Light, but Borini later opted to stay at Liverpool.

The one-cap Italy international went on to make just 12 Premier League appearances last season.
