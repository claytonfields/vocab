In an alleged attempt to boost recruitment, former Miami police chief Manuel Orosa allowed a local television production company to film a trailer for a proposed reality show called ‘Miami Blue: The Real Miami Vice’. Filmed in late 2013 and just now coming to light, the trailer features luxury condos, boats, big drug busts, and of course, scantily clad female Miami police officers.

Union president Lt. Javier Ortiz, who is shown in the video, told the Miami Herald that “when I asked who was taking the video, Orosa told me it was for recruitment purposes.” According to Orosa however, it was never intended for recruitment purposes, but rather for a $40,000 donation to the Police Athletic League, should the show get picked up. But the show never got picked up by a network, and now the promotional trailer is floating around the internet for all to see.

Current Miami police chief Rodolfo Llanes, who claims to have only discovered its existence on Monday, condemned the video for objectifying female officers and said he was going to speak with an attorney.
