A certain Sabeer Ansari from Muzaffarpur in Bihar has filed a complaint against Salman Khan, Anushka Sharma, the director and Yash Raj Films alleging that ‘Sultan’ storyline has been copied from his real life journey.

According to Sabeer’s allegation, Salman Khan had contacted him for making a film on his life story. He had even promised to pay him 20 crores, which he never did. After a few days of their meeting, Sabeer Ansari was told that the film had been shelved. Now that it is out there in every theatre, breaking new records every day, Sabeer Ansari feels cheated.
