Daimler has announced Mercedes-AMG has acquired a 25 percent stake in Italian motorcycle manufacturer MV Agusta.

At first it was only a rumor but now we have confirmation from Daimler about purchasing a 25 percent stake in MV Agusta through its Mercedes-AMG division. The transaction price has not been disclosed but the report from last week said a €30 million deal was done between the two parties. Mercedes-AMG and MV Agusta will have a long-term relationship which will include a cooperation in the areas of marketing and sales.

The deal will be finalized towards the end of next month and Mercedes-AMG has announced they will appoint one member in MV Agusta's board of directors. Tobias Moers, Chief Executive of Mercedes-AMG GmbH said "in MV Agusta, we have found the perfect two-wheel partner for Mercedes-AMG” which will provide “an entry into the world of additional high-performance enthusiasts."

Giovanni Castiglioni, President and CEO of MV Agusta Motor S.p.A. declared that "Mercedes-AMG will help MV Agusta to further expand globally and to accelerate our growth. The uniqueness of MV Agusta will further enhance Mercedes-AMG’s leadership in the high-performance segment."
