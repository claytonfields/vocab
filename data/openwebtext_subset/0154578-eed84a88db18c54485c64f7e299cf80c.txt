Mr Johnson will on Thursday be joined by Mr Gove as he launches his bid for the Conservative Party leadership. He is expected to say that while he is "pro-immigration" he wants to see an end to the free movement of EU citizens.

Friends said that he will set out his "positive" vision for Britain and suggest that Brexit offers people the chance to "believe in ourselves and the values of this country".

Mr Johnson and Mr Gove are "rock solid" and that there is "no split" between the two men, friends insisted. Sources close to Mr Gove said that the leaked email represented the "personal opinion" of his wife rather than his own.

Theresa May, the Home Secretary, will launch her campaign for the Conservative Party leadership less than an hour after Mr Johnson as she sets out her vision for "a country that works for everyone".

Mrs May, who campaigned for Britain to stay in the European Union, will attempt to win the support of Eurosceptics by announcing the creation of a new Government department which is responsible for Brexit negotiations.
