As announced on Toonami Preflight tonight, Viz Media is bringing their English dub premiere of Hunter X Hunter to Toonami on April 16th at 1 AM. Even though this has been one of the top 5 most requested shows before, no one thought Toonami would pull the trigger and get another long-running series. We will be posting up Viz Media’s press release here as well once we get it. What do you guys think of this big news? Like the show choice and does it matter that it’s a long-running series? Let us know by commenting below.

Update 4/2/16: Jason DeMarco answered a question on his Ask.fm about Hunter X Hunter and this is what he said:

Seems Hunter X Hunter will stay as long as ratings are good so it may not run 148 episodes if we don’t watch. Comment below and let us know what you think.
