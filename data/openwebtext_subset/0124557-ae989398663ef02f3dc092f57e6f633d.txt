Nintendo will discontinue a bunch of online Wii services in June, the company has announced.

You'll no longer be able to send and receive messages with other users via the Wii Message Board or access a number of Channel apps.

The big switch-off will happen in the UK on 28th June, Nintendo confirmed to Eurogamer.

For the chop are the Nintendo Channel, News Channel, Forecast Channel, Everybody Votes Channel and Mii Contest Channel. The News and Weather channels were kept updated for more than seven years, sniff.

Notably, however, the Wii Shop Channel will remain open - for now.

"We at Nintendo sincerely thank you for your continued patronage of our company's products," said Mario. "We apologise to those of you currently using these services, and ask for your understanding.

"The above services will no longer be available even if they are started up from the Wii Menu. However, services other than those mentioned above, such as the Wii Shop Channel and 'Today's Accomplishments' on the Wii Message Board, will remain available."
