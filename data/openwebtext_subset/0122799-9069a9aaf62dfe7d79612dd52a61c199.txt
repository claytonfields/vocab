POTUS Trump SLAMS “Fake News” WaPo in Fiery Tweetstorm

President Trump unleashed a tweetstorm on Fake News WaPo Monday evening. The President accused WaPo of fabricating facts on his decision to end Obama’s funding of Syrian ‘rebels’.

Trump said that Fake News WaPo is just as bad as CNN. OUCH! He also questioned if they are being used as lobbyists to keep politicians from looking into Amazon’s no-tax policy.
