Donald Trump fired back at Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Tuesday after she took a number of swings at his campaign for president.

“I think it’s highly inappropriate that a United States Supreme Court judge gets involved in a political campaign, frankly,” Trump told the New York Times. “I think it’s a disgrace to the court, and I think she should apologize to the court. I couldn’t believe it when I saw it.”

Early Wednesday morning, Trump escalated his attack against the Supreme Court justice. He tweeted that “her mind is shot” and called for her resignation:

Justice Ginsburg of the U.S. Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me. Her mind is shot – resign! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 13, 2016





In recent interviews with The Times and Associated Press, Ginsburg repeatedly criticized Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee. Her comments stunned a number of observers as Supreme Court justices rarely comment publicly on presidential campaigns.

Among other things, the left-leaning jurist said she couldn’t imagine a Trump presidency, joked that she would move to New Zealand if he won and implied he would do lasting damage to the court.

But Ginsburg does not appear to be holding back. In a Tuesday interview with CNN, she doubled down on her criticism and called him a “faker.”

“He has no consistency about him,” Ginsburg said. “He says whatever comes into his head at the moment. He really has an ego. … How has he gotten away with not turning over his tax returns? The press seems to be very gentle with him on that.”

Trump told the Times that he “would hope that she would get off the court as soon as possible.”
