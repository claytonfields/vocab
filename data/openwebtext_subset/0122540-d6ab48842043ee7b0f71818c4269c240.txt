"The incoming winter storm is forecasted to hit the Hudson Valley, New York City and Long Island beginning first thing tomorrow, with the heaviest snow starting in the afternoon and reaching a rate of 1-4 inches an hour. As a result, commuters should consider working from home on Monday if possible to avoid disruptions from likely road and public transportation closures," Cuomo said. "New York State is taking all necessary precautions to prepare for this storm, and I urge residents to put safety first and plan ahead to protect themselves and others throughout the duration of this snowstorm."

Cuomo said if it's not possible to work from home, commuters should plan to leave work early Monday.

Snow accumulations of 24-36 inches are currently expected across Long Island by the end of Tuesday night.

Heavy snow will be accompanied by winds of 30-40 mph, with gusts up to 65 mph, leading to "extremely dangerous travel" with whiteout conditions likely, according to a blizzard warning issued by the National Weather Service. Visibility on the roadways will be a quarter mile or less throughout the storm.
