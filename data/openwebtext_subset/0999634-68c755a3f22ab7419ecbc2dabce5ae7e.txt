So i opened up my gift that came earlier on tonight. The postman just left it outside my f---ing door for anyone to take, but luckily i live in a decent are. Well anyway, when i picked it up it was actually really light in a relatively large box, so I was thinking about some million handkerchiefs or something or the infamous 4 paperclips Well anyway, I went up to the study as the things I put in my likes might not be entirely visible to my parents if really fulfilled, so you know, just some viewer privacy just in case it's a bong or a crop. Well i opened the thing, and was blinded by the colours. it took me a while to actually realise what it was, but then i figured it out and turned it upside down. It's actually really awesome. I have no idea how the ss figured out i might enjoy kids toys, but i guess r/teenagers does say enough. Well anyway, take a look at my awesome gift in action in the video below :) Thanks so much mr anonymous, i will enjoy this gift a lot... once the circumstances you told me will happen. I might just get drunk with my mum and my step dad just so that I can enjoy this gift fully. Thanks again, Jonáš :)
