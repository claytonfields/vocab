Mauricio Pochettino's ​Tottenham Hotspur look set to make their first signing of the Summer transfer window.





According to ​football.london, Espanyol's Loanee keeper Pau Lopez is set to permanently join Tottenham Hotspur for a reported fee agreed at €2.5m.

The Spanish youngster was down the pecking order behind Hugo Lloris and Michel Vorm last season and as a result, played in the U-23 team.





He is, however, expected to push his place above second choice keeper Michel Vorm in order to get some more game time with the Lilywhites.

Previous reports understand that the player enjoys living in London and despite lack of game time in the first team, really likes the direction the club is heading to under the helm of Mauricio Pochettino.





In his time as the first choice goalie at Espanyol, Lopez averaged a total of 2.36 saves per game as well as keeping a total of seven clean sheets and maintaining an 88% claim success rate.

Before the transfer window opened Lopez was still undecided as to whether he would play for the North London side or head back home; but didn't rule out a permanent move to White Hart Lane.





Now that Spurs are close to sealing the deal with the young Spaniard, many fans will hope to see him get first team action at Wembley stadium next season.
