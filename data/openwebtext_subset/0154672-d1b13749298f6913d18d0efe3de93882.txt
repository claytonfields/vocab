The injured were rushed to Hadassah Mount Scopus and Hadassah Ein Kerem hospitals in Jerusalem

Hadassah Mount Scopus spokesman Ron Kromer confirmed that three children were admitted to the medical center's burn unit, suffering from extensive burns to their face. "They are in very serious condition," he said.

According to available details, the bus was transporting Palestinian children from Qalandiya and flipped over from the force of the collision.

Danny Rotenberg, MDA spokesman in the Jerusalem sector, told Ynet that "This was a head-on collision between a truck and a bus transporting children.

"The force of the collision caused the bus to flip over and catch fire. We have 10 casualties on the scene and we are making sure that there arenâ€™t any more."

The Israeli and Palestinian police are collaborating on the investigation.

Benzion Oring, head of ZAKA's Jerusalem office, told Ynet that that the Disaster Victim Identification teams had trouble finding the scene at first, as the area is close to Palestinian villages.

"By 9 am MDA declared a mass casualty event. We arrived at the scene after we made sure to get the necessary permits. Red Crescent teams and local volunteers were in the midst of a rescue operation and we were told that the bodies of several children had already been evacuated.

"The truck driver had apparently sustained mediocre wounds. Any scene that involves children is always very difficult," he said.

The Civil Administration has liaised with Palestinian authorities to assist in the evacuation efforts.

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas declared three days of mourning following the tragic accident.
