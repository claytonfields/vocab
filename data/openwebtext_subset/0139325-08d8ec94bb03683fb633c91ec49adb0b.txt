The Atlanta Falcons wrapped up in the NFC South title and their first playoff berth since 2012 after beating the Carolina Panthers over the weekend (33-16), then watching New Orleans take out Tampa Bay (31-24).

With the first-place finish, the 10-5 Falcons now know they'll face the first-place teams in both the NFC East and NFC West -- Dallas and Seattle -- next season.

Here are the home and road opponents for 2017. The dates of each game will be determined in the spring when the full regular-season schedule is released.

Home opponents: Carolina Panthers, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, New Orleans Saints, Green Bay Packers, Minnesota Vikings, Buffalo Bills, Miami Dolphins, Dallas Cowboys.

Road opponents: Carolina Panthers, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, New Orleans Saints, Chicago Bears, Detroit Lions, New England Patriots, New York Jets, Seattle Seahawks.

My take: The Falcons won't nearly have as much traveling to do next season with the game at Seattle the only extended trip after visits to Seattle, Denver, Los Angeles, and Oakland this season. The trip to New England should be fun with Matt Ryan and Tom Brady a couple of the front-runners for this year's MVP honor. The game against the Jets also should be interesting because Todd Bowles really wanted the Falcons job, and some thought Dan Quinn initially was headed to the Jets. The Falcons will see a healthier Vikings team with (potentially) Adrian Peterson and Teddy Bridgewater coming off injuries. The Cowboys, Patriots, Seahawks, and Dolphins are among the playoff teams on the '17 slate, with the Packers and Lions still in the mix.
