The friendship between Michigan State coach Tom Izzo and Indiana coach Tom Crean was on display in a very private way on Sunday.

Crean’s mother is having health issues and not able to travel from Michigan to Indiana for basketball games, Crean said tonight during his weekly radio show.

Crean’s mom was able to make it to Sunday’s game between IU and Michigan State in East Lansing, Mich.

Izzo arranged for his wife to host Crean’s mom in her suite area and gave Crean’s mom his personal parking pass. “It was the closest one to the arena,” Crean said.

Crean told that story as the latest example of how Izzo helps out those around him.

Crean was an assistant to Izzo at Michigan State early in his career.

The two got to know each other when Crean was coaching at Alma College while a student at Central Michigan. A trip to recruiting events in Pittsburgh, Cincinnati and Rensselaer, Ind., was when the friendship really began to take shape.

“He took me with him, and that was one of the greatest experiences I had about learning about recruiting, about players. But the greater experience was, this is what someone is capable of as far as caring about you,” Crean said.

“He had no other reason other than he wanted to help you. Our friendship has been incredibly strong, and he’s as close of a friend as I have.”

Crean also mentioned Izzo being up for the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame this year.

“If he’s not unanimous, they need to take someone’s credentials,” Crean said.
