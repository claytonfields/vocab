Of Mice and Men, the John Steinbeck novella, is one of a number of American classics that have been axed from new English literature GCSEs after the education secretary insisted students must study British works.

Michael Gove’s intervention means three-quarters of the books on the government directed GCSEs, which will be unveiled this week, are by British authors and most are pre-20th century.

OCR, one of Britain’s biggest exam boards, said: "Of Mice and Men, which Michael Gove really dislikes, will not be included. It was studied by 90% of teenagers taking English literature GCSE in the past.

"Michael Gove said that was a really disappointing statistic."

The exam board added: "In the new syllabus 70-80% of the books are from the English canon."

However, university professors warned the measures may put off teenagers from studying English literature.

Bethan Marshall, senior lecturer in English at King's College, London, and chairwoman of the National Association for the Teaching of English, told the Sunday Times: "It's a syllabus out of the 1940s and rumour has it Michael Gove, who read literature, designed it himself. Schools will be incredibly depressed when they see it.

"Kids will be put off doing A-level literature by this. Many teenagers will think that being made to read Dickens aged 16 is just tedious. This will just grind children down."

Exam boards were made to follow strict guidelines from the Department for Education when drawing up the new literature GCSE.

Teenagers will face exams at the end of two year and will not be able to undertake coursework.

From 2015, teenagers taking the OCR English literature exam will have to study a pre-20th-century novel by a British author, poetry by the Romantics, and a Shakespeare play.
