As we saw in the 2016 Democratic primary, Hillary Clinton doesn’t like to debate. She’d rather focus on rigging the election.

After all, Hillary Clinton lost in many states to Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT), but “won” votes from Superdelegates. This corrupt process is why she won the nomination.

Hillary Clinton is terrified to debate Trump. That’s because Trump works without a filter, and is willing to bring up subjects that other Republicans would never touch, especially about Hillary’s treatment of women abused and assaulted by President Bill Clinton.

Due to health problems, Hillary Clinton just cancelled a fundraiser in North Carolina. After that serious collapse on September 11, the rest of her schedule this month is now in question.

In front of cameras, Hillary looks tired and drained. Reporters are now focused on uncovering just what’s wrong with Hillary.

Today, political insiders believe Hillary is about to drop out of the first debate against Donald Trump! As a conservative leader told Gateway Pundit:

“Hearing smart guys say that Hillary may cancel the debate on Monday … Hillary may be trying to run out the clock because she thinks she is ahead.”

Maybe Hillary is concerned about having another attack or problem on stage that her staff couldn’t hide? This could change the entire 2016 presidential campaign, as Trump is already surging ahead in all national polling.
