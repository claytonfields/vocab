Filipe Luis, Atletico Madrid defender, spoke to Panenka magazine on various issues, including his relationship with Leo Messi, whom he has battled on many occasions. It's always an intense duel, never more so than in February 2016 when he was sent off for kicking the star.

However the Brazilian said: "I admire him. He's never reproached me in any of the games we've played. I've never asked for his shirt, because I go onto the pitch to win, not to say that I played against him."

Regarding Neymar he said: "He chose correctly to sign for PSG. They will see he is different. He's free and happy. At the level which Neymar is, you don't change teams for money."

On Paulinho, his compatriot, he said: "He'll surprise a lot of people, if he doesn't fit in at Barcelona he would at Atletico."
