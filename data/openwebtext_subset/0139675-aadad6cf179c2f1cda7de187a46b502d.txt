You can swim with plenty of interesting—and sometimes theoretically scary—things: stingrays, dolphins, whales , whale sharks, even real sharks . But what about those paddlers of the porcine persuasion? Yep, we're talking about pigs. Lucky for you, in the Bahamas' Exumas there's a place where such thrills can be had—and it's called Big Major Cay. No one knows for sure how these pigs arrived: some speculate they were dropped off temporarily by sailors; others think it's all a ploy designed by the Bahamian government to attract tourists. Whatever the case, the pigs are friendly—and evidently love posing for selfies. Want proof? Here are the best Instagram snaps from #pigbeach.

Spotted: the world's cutest pillow.
