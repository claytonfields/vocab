As the alternate uniform craze has swept through college football, some programs with “traditional” uniforms such as Notre Dame, Ohio State and Nebraska have embraced the trend, either tweaking their standard game jerseys or experimenting with alternative looks.

Don’t expect Texas to join them under head coach Charlie Strong.

Charlie Strong laughed about idea of Texas ever having alternate uniforms while he’s head coach. As he put it… — Max Olson (@max_olson) July 21, 2015

Strong: “The way this place is, if I walk out there with a black uniform, it’s ‘what is he doing?!’ Way too dangerous” — Max Olson (@max_olson) July 21, 2015

Strong has a point. Texas’ metallic helmet decals against Oklahoma State last season drew the ire of some fans. Better to leave that burnt orange and white alone.
