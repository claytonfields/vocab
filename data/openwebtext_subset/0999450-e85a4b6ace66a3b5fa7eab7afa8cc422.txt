“Retired” actress Amanda Bynes is quickly gaining on Lindsay Lohan for the coveted title of most troubled former child star.

While Lohan has your run-of-the-mill substance abuse issues, the former Nickelodeon star has been reportedly been wreaking havoc in New York City during a spree of bizarre behavior.

Over the weekend, Bynes reportedly went to an adult gymnastics class in New York City and “showed up in fishnets and a leotard that looked like lingerie,” Page Six reports.

Bynes was allegedly “muttering to herself” and then “burst into tears when she attempted a cartwheel and her dark-colored wig fell off.”

“She immediately started acting strangely,” a “source” told Page Six. “She lined up with the other gymnasts, and each took their turn to perform a roll. But Amanda just walked out on the mat, was spinning around in circles and mumbling to herself.”

Bynes was then asked to leave the class and was reportedly escorted out.

The incident is similar to the time she was allegedly asked to leave a spinning class after she took off her shirt — revealing nothing but a black bra — and began applying make-up in the gym mirror.

Bynes tweeted last week that she was planning on suing some gossip sites and magazines for claiming she had mental health issues.

She cleared that up by posting that she doesn’t have mental health issues, but that she just “has an eating disorder.”
