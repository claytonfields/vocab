What’s really going up in there in the skies?

History recently gave a 10-episode straight to series order to “Blue Book,” a scripted UFO drama from A+E Studios and Compari Entertainment. Created and written on spec by David O’Leary, the series chronicles the true top secret U.S. Air Force-sponsored investigations into UFO-related phenomena in the 1950s and ’60s, known as “Project Blue Book.”

Game of Thrones alum Aidan Gillen is set as the lead with Maleficent helmer Robert Stromberg, an Oscar and Emmy-winning production designer/special effects artist, set to direct the first two episodes of the series, which “Follows Dr. J. Allen Hynek, a brilliant college professor recruited by the U.S. Air Force to spearhead this clandestine operation that researched thousands of cases, many of which were never solved. Each episode will draw from the actual files, blending UFO theories with authentic historical events from one of the most mysterious eras in United States history.”

“Rarely have I been associated with a project that is a perfect fusion of historical fact and extraordinary entertainment,” said executive producer Robert Zemeckis. “We are grateful for A+E Studios’ and History’s support for what I know will be a fabulous series.”

Zemeckis and his ImageMovers partner Jack Rapke (Cast Away, Flight) and the company’s Jackie Levine (Allied, The Walk) executive produce for Compari.
