I love Daft Punk and when I first heard the remix version was on youtube from an audiophile named Kennrick Sound in Japan. This audio group takes high end JBL speakers and modifies the magnets, coils, and electronic components of the crossovers to make the speakers sound exceptionally better than they come out of the factory. The speakers sells for minimum $10k U.S. and quickly skyrockets depending on model and so forth. Anyhow, I had to get this single so I can play it on my audio setup at home. It sounds great out of my AR speakers! It even sounds great through my Beyerdynamic earphones as well using a mid 70's solid-state Sansui receiver. Best to use a good quality cartridge to really enjoy this record. I recommend at least an elliptical stylus or higher quality. If you can, play it on a Shibata stylus and it will sound superb! I use a Denon DL-160 MC high output cart and it sounds very good.
