As we know it



The claims of an apocalypse-like situation may be wrong. But, it can’t be denied that millions of people around the world die every year because of natural disasters like earthquake, flood, tsunami and tornado. The world faces about 600 disasters every year. In a report titled Natural Disaster Hotspots: A Global Risk Analysis, experts from the World Bank, Columbia and the Norwegian Geotechnical Institute say more than half of the world population live in high disaster areas. In the US alone, they say, more than one-third people live in hazard-prone areas. Not only this, many poor countries face ‘a constant pounding’ because of these disasters and fail to get out of a ‘never-ending cycle of recovery’.

Need for change

Most of the casualty during natural disasters is because of the faulty building structures. Disaster management experts believe that this can be averted with the use of disaster-proof designs. Some of the recent home models designed to resist disasters have been discussed here.

How can we make buildings resist Tsunamis?

Buildings come in the path of high-speed waves during tsunamis. This creates extreme pressure on the wall and may cause its fall. To avoid this, buildings should be built on a higher base to allow the water to flow underneath. Suspended floors should be used for combating some of the force of the waves. The frames should be built extra strong. Also, it is important to maintain the mangrove swamps and coral reefs as they resist tsunamis.

Whatâs Next?

1. F9 Flood-Proof House

Whatâs new?

The F9 Flood-Proof House has been built for resisting toughest floods. The small house has been raised above the ground level and built mostly with durable materials. Solar panels has been used for providing electricity and eco-friendly measures like rainwater harvesting and skylight for permitting natural light to enter the home.

What difference will it make?

Different measures like elevated base, nicely tucked away storage areas and the use of reused durable materials for construction will allow this house to withstand toughest floods. Not only this, it will prove a sustainable abode during normal times.

2. Luxury underground homes

Whatâs new?

Designed by US-based company Vivos, this luxury home can withstand all forms of apocalyptic scenario yet imagined. It will be built underground and feature on-site power and water wells for a long term off-the-grid living. The residents will also have access to year-long supply of medicine, food and fuel for health and comfort. There are also plans for community spaces for replicating city social life and a medical center for attending the sick or injured people during disasters.

What difference will it make?

According to the company, each system of the luxury apocalypse home will have ten units that will house about 200 people. It will provide them comfort and space for community interaction during disasters.

3. Pyramid home

Whatâs new?

Designed by Korvelo, the pyramid-shaped home can withstand all forms of natural disaster. Be it a tsunami, tornado, earthquake or floods. While, the cone-shaped top helps it negotiate high speed winds, the 40-feet above the ground living space keep the residents safe from high water during tsunami or floods. The pyramid home features five bedrooms and six bathrooms. There are three garages, four cameras, four light covered and four remote-controlled weapons. Also, the exterior of the house can be fitted with solar panels for electricity generation.

What difference will it make?

There are multiple benefits of a pyramid structure. It can withstand high speed winds and tornadoes. The elevated living space can negotiate with with high water levels. Besides, the bullet proof windows and remote-controlled weapons will allow the occupants to fight with any outside human intrusion, especially during riots or wars.
