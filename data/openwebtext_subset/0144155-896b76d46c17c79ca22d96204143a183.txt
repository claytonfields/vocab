The government website posted a picture of three local officials inspecting a highway project on June 16. The image of the three was patched against a background of a highway, making them appear as if they were floating on air.

The picture was soon widely distributed and criticised on the internet. As a result, the Huili government registered for a micro blog on Monday and apologised for the doctored picture: "A government employee posted the edited picture out of error. ... The county government understands the wide attention, and hopes to apologise and clarify the matter."

The photographer said in an apology that he combined some pictures taken on the day of the inspection because the original shots were not good.
