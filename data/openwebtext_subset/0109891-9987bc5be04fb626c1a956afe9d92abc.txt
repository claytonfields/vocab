House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi addresses the reported deal Democrats made with President Trump on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. She says that both sides agreed it is most important not to have "two kinds" of residents in the U.S.



"It is not even second-class citizenship, because it isn't citizenship," she said about the current state of the DACA program. "It is about everyone in our country having the opportunity to earn the path to citizenship, it is an earned path to citizenship."

QUESTION: The president in Florida just said we are not looking at citizenship or amnesty.



REP. NANCY PELOSI: We're not looking at amnesty, never looking at amnesty.



QUESTION: But the citizenship, he said--



PELOSI: That's in the bill.



QUESTION: So he seems to not--



PELOSI: You know what? Maybe. I'm not here to respond to tweets, you asked me about the meeting. I'm telling you where we are after the meeting.



I think the issue of citizenship is not just about these young people, or about other undocumented immigrants in our country, who under a comprehensive immigration reform, should, in my view, be on a long term path, an earned path, towards citizenship. This is an earned path to citizenship, whether it is work, military service, education, it is not just about them though, as important as that is. It is about who we are as a country. We're not having two different kinds of people live here. It is not even second-class citizenship, because it isn't citizenship. It is about everyone in our country having the opportunity to earn the path to citizenship, it is an earned path to citizenship.
