You're a bartender.

You've recently been diagnosed with an awful form of amnesia.

Because of this, your boss told you that you need to serve 64 happy customers before your shift ends; or you're fired.

It doesn't matter how you make a drink so long as you remember your recipe.

TL;DR: Make drinks, make up recipes, remember the recipe you made up.

Hints:

You make up the recipe for every drink.

If the customer asks for the same drink, you have to do the same recipe.

Drinks can't share recipes; otherwise, they wouldn't be different drinks.
