Chandler, Ariz., native Brett Hundley chose to play his college ball outside of the state, but he appears to be open to returning to the Valley for his professional career.

The former UCLA quarterback was on “The Rich Eisen Show” last week and was asked about the prospect of playing for the Arizona Cardinals.

“That would be awesome. That would be amazing,” Hundley told “The Rich Eisen Show.” “To go home and play for your hometown team when you grew up not too far away, that would be a dream come true.”

The 6-foot-3, 227-pound QB enjoyed a three-year career with the Bruins, throwing for 9,966 yards and 75 touchdowns with 25 interceptions. He led the Pac-12 in passing completions and yards during his freshman season, and his career completion percentage of 67.6 is the second-highest in conference history since 1956.

Hundley was also a prolific runner, gaining 1,747 yards on 479 attempts (3.6 yards per rush) with 30 touchdowns over the course of his career. He led the program to a 29-11 record during his three years under center.

As much of a “dream” as returning to Arizona would be for the Chandler High graduate, NFL.com writer Dan Parr says the chances are slim he’d land with his hometown team. Parr says spending a first-round pick on a quarterback other than Marcus Mariota of Oregon or Jameis Winston of Florida State would be a reach for any NFL team, and that those two standouts should be long gone by the time Arizona makes the 24th selection in the draft.

Hundley may be worth a look for the Cardinals in the second round, Parr says, but the team seems to have three viable signal callers on the roster already.

The Cardinals spent a fourth-round pick on Logan Thomas last year, but if Arians has decided Thomas isn’t the team’s quarterback of the future, perhaps he’ll take a chance on Hundley and groom him behind Carson Palmer.
