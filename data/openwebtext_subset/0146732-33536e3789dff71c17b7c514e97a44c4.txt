NDP Leader John Horgan and B.C. Green Party Leader Andrew Weaver officially informed the lieutenant governor Wednesday of their deal to topple Liberal Premier Christy Clark and install a minority government.

Horgan and Weaver visited Lt.-Gov. Judith Guichon’s residence at Government House in Victoria to deliver their written accord, along with a letter signed by 44 members of the NDP and Green caucuses. One of Guichon’s representatives met the leaders at the main entrance and accepted the agreement.

The pact gives the NDP and Greens a majority of votes in the 87-seat legislature and the ability to defeat the 43-seat Liberal government once the house sits again.

The Greens have promised to back an NDP minority government on confidence motions over four years to prevent it from falling. In exchange, the parties have agreed to work together on key issues such as fighting the Kinder Morgan pipeline expansion, banning big money from B.C. politics and holding a referendum on changing the electoral system.

Liberal Leader Christy Clark remains the premier for now, but has said she expects to go down to defeat once she recalls the legislature and introduces a throne speech, likely in the next few weeks. If the government falls, Guichon would have the option of calling another election or approaching Horgan to form a government.

Horgan said Wednesday that Clark and Guichon will decide what happens next.

“We’ve discharged our responsibilities and now it’s up to others to make those choices,” he said, leaving Government House.

Weaver said he will answer questions at a later point about how a minority NDP government will choose a Speaker and what role the Greens expect to play in a minority NDP government.

“Right now, today was about giving the lieutenant governor an option — an option to form a government with 44 MLAs,” he said.
