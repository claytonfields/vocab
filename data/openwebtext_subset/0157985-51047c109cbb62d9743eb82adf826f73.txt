This is a pleasant-looking rooftop garden:

But it’s got one very unusual feature: It’s on top of a bus.

Conceived by Spanish landscape artist Marc Grañén and green roofer Alex Puig, the buses use a light hydroponic foam, instead of soil, and you can see how they’re installed here:

The prototype buses have been tooling around towns near Barcelona, Urban Gardens reports:

The bus is on the road these days transporting tourists to and from a nature and camping facility in Estartit near Girona. But Grañén is in discussions with a major auto company who has expressed interest in sponsoring a fleet in Barcelona. In the meantime, Grañén’s received approval to plant the vehicle roofs of a Barcelona landscape design company and another in Girona which he’ll be unveiling in a few days. In September, Grañén will take one of those vans on the road to the World Green Infrastructure Congress, an international event in Nantes, France about developing green infrastructures.

Obviously, cute kids can’t play in the gardens while they’re in motion. But the plants can keep sucking up carbon dioxide and breathing out fresh oxygen even while they’re taking in the view from the roof.
