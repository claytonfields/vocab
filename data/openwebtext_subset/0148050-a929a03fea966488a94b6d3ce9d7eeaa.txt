Gnocl Development Blogs



We live in a connected world, messages take seconds to bounce around the world and, lets face it, it's as easy to talk to web buddy in Karachi as it is to call across the house the one's spouse in the kitchen. We've become familiar with chat, familiar with getting regular feedback on whatever's happening out there. Miss-out of the latest gossip and there's a fair chance that interest will be lost. Hence the Gnocl development blog. If you're like me, th en as you code away you'll have notebooks, lots of them with jottings and ideas scribbled down. So many jottings that, lets face it, they're lost. The idea of creating a Gnocl blog then, is not just to promote interest in Gnocl, but also to keep together some ideas and code snippets that are being worked on at the time. Blogspot provides a convenient place to to this, its possibly entertaining too, in a geeky sort of way. If you want to read more, follow this link.....





Gnocl for MS-Windows

Although most widely though of as a *nix development environment, Gtk+ libraries are available for a number of platforms including Microsoft Windows and Apple's MacOSx. Many dyed in the wool Tcler's tend to shy away from the idea of using anything other that Tk for UI development. Well, now's the chance for them to try the latest and stable development release of Gnocl and they don't even need to download dependencies and compile the sources -oh you lucky people! Following this link for more!



Gnocl for MacOSx? Can it be true? The lack of cross platform support has been a criticism often made against Gnocl but, things are about to change.



Already development versions of the the Mac ready Gnocl core package and its complementary package GnoclMacOSX are available for download thanks to the hard efforts of Mac/Tcl developer Zbigniew Diaczyszyn.







Making the cross-over from Linux desktop to Snow Leopard has not been easy as Zbigniew will confirm. The major difference between the Gtk and Mac UI design is the issue of menu bars. These have to be handled somewhat differently in order to get that 'authentic Mac look'. In fact, this is why Mac options are handled in a specific, unique package. They can be developed independently of the main Gnocl core giving branch developers the freedom they need to create exciting new platform specific extensions.
