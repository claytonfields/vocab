Fun Fact: Star-Lord's Ship in 'Guardians of the Galaxy' Is Named After This '80s Dream Girl

If you're someone who grew up in the late '80s, Guardians of the Galaxy is totally your jam. There are so many fun, nerdy references from that era littered throughout the latest Marvel Studios movie, but there's one particular reference you may have missed.

In the film, Peter Quill (aka Star-Lord, aka Chris Pratt) has his own spaceship called the Milano. But why is it called the Milano? Is that some hard-core Marvel reference buried deep within the Guardians' comic history? Nope. The Milano is named after Peter Quill's childhood crush, Alyssa Milano.

As per director James Gunn:

For those of you who asked, yes, Quill’s ship The Milano is named after his awesome childhood crush @Alyssa_Milano. #GuardiansoftheGalaxy — James Gunn (@JamesGunn) July 29, 2014

Back in the late '80s, you'd be hard-pressed to find a young dude who didn't have a crush on Alyssa Milano, thanks to her appearance on the hit sitcom Who's the Boss. She was like the ultimate down-to-earth dream girl, competing with the likes of Punky Brewster and Vicki the Robot from Small Wonder (sure, why not?) for the hearts of all young males approaching puberty.

Like Quill, yours truly had such a crush on Milano that I actually wrote a letter to her fan club at 10 years old, coyly slipping past my parents in a parking lot in order to secretly drop it in the mailbox before anyone could see. It was the first and last time I would ever tell a girl I had a crush on her through the mail, mainly because I never got a response. Alyssa Milano: crushin' hearts since 1984.

If you got to pilot some super awesome spaceship, what would you name it and why?
