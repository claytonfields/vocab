​ Former NBA player DeShawn Stevenson made over $28 million in salary during his NBA career.





However, it seems as though that wasn't enough to pay for his exorbitant spending. Stevenson, who last played for the Atlanta Hawks back in 2013, is in trouble with American Express, ​according to Bossip . Stevenson had a coveted AMEX Black Card based on the fact that he was rich (once), but never paid the bill and now owes the company $384,000.

In a judgement against Stevenson, a court ruled that American Express could go into his bank accounts to cover the outstanding balance. The only problem? He had $62.09 available in his Bank of America account.

While it's entirely possible that he's hiding his money elsewhere, images like the one below lead me to believe he didn't plan ahead financially.

The disturbing trend of ex-athletes who are now broke continues. Upon entering the big-money sports leagues, athletes should be educated on all of the risks involved with excess spending. Unfortunately, Stevenson can be used as an example of what not to turn out like.
