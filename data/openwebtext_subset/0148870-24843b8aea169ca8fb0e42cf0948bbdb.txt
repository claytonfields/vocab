We were sure that sharp long nails-claws remained in the dashing 90s, but no: they were renamed "vampire" and called a new trend in manicure. Terrible or cool?





(1) The diffusion effect

Like a fingernail - a reservoir of water, which dripped red wine: the bizarre lines of the process of mixing liquids look very impressive

(2) Black marble

The pearls of mother-of-pearl on a deep black background mimic a rare stone.

(3) Spiral

Unexpected accent on the little finger in the form of an augmented nail curled around its axis.

(4) Black Opal

Rare stone - black Australian opal - before processing looks like this: beige-gray stone, inside which lies a stunning beauty blue core.

(5) Inrush

Another 3D manicure, simulating a stain of paint.

(6) Gothic

The pattern in the form of spider webs, spiders and skulls fits perfectly into vampire themes.

(7) All at once

The night sky, blood, fangs - that the theme was clear from the first presentation.

(8) Mirror

You can combine two trends: vampire claws and a mirror metallized coating.

(9) Checkmate

With matte coating, the nails look even more dramatic.

(10) Gradient

Red and black with a beautiful shade transition.
