Onslow County Sheriff Hans Miller said the son of Steven Sanchez was in a private vehicle in the parking lot of the fire station when he found his dad's gun and discharged it. Neither the child nor anyone else was injured, and no charges were filed.

The fire chief of the Piney Green Volunteer Fire Department has resigned following a recent incident during which his young child got hold of a gun and fired it while in the parking lot of the station.

Onslow County Sheriff Hans Miller said the son of Steven Sanchez was in a private vehicle in the parking lot of the fire station when he found his dad’s gun and discharged it. Neither the child nor anyone else was injured.

The incident occurred on the evening of July 3 and was reported on July 4, Miller said.

Miller said they checked the gun and it was not stolen and is legally owned.

He said no adults witnessed what happened, and after discussing the incident with the magistrate, no charges were filed.

However, Miller stressed the importance for firearm safety.

“I support lawful gun ownership but it’s paramount that we safeguard children from unsupervised access to firearms,” Miller said.

Officials with the Piney Green Volunteer Fire Department confirmed there was an incident but gave few details.

“We can confirm that there was a negligent discharge of a weapon that involved a minor. The minor was not left without adult supervision. No one was injured in the incident and the incident was reported to the proper authorities. Mr. Sanchez voluntarily resigned as chief and there is an interim chief in place. Immediate corrective actions were taken by the Board of Directors to ensure that an incident like this does not occur again in the future,” Piney Green VFD President Tim VanPelt said in a statement in response to questions from The Daily News.

He said Brandy Bruns is serving as intern chief.

He called the incident an internal matter and said that to protect the parties involved he could not comment further.
