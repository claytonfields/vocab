Around 9:00 PM EST, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey (@jack) was suspended from his very own social media platform.

While only lasting roughly ten minutes, the suspension is important because it shows that Dorsey may have received too many reports in a short amount of time, triggering the auto-suspension function on his account. As it went down, the Twitter-sphere exploded into a gradient of emotions.
