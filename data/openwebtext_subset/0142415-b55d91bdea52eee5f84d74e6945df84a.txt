The first flock of games to support Xbox Play Anywhere have been listed. These are the games that will be cross-buy on Windows 10 and Xbox One, which means if you buy one version, you get the other free, and your saved games and add-ons work with both.

Microsoft announced Xbox Play Anywhere during it's E3 2016 press conference, and it sounds like all of the first-party games will support it going forward. The list isn't much of a surprise, then, but it's there for reference nonetheless.

The Xbox Play Anywhere games:

Gears of War 4

Forza Horizon 3

ReCore

Sea of Thieves

Halo Wars 2

Scalebound

Killer Instinct Season 3

State of Decay 2

Ark: Survival Evolved

Cuphead

We Happy Few

Crackdown 3

There's an Xbox Play Anywhere FAQ but it doesn't add anything noteworthy enough to put down here.
