Seven mayors from France called on President Emmanuel Macron to step in and help them deal with the flow of (illegal) immigrants from Africa and the Middle East.

French daily Le Monde published a letter written by the mayors of Strasbourg, Grenoble, Rennes, Nantes, Toulouse, Lille, and Bordeaux. In the letter, the mayors say that they are forced to take in "several thousand" refugees every month. This tsunami is creating massive social problems, they go on to explain. They feel that they're "backed up against a wall" and "completely saturated."

The mayors want Macron to establish a "solidarity network" between the cities of France "dedicated to addressing the flow of migrants," as well as an "enlarged meeting with the state at the highest level," which the mayors say must act quickly by assuming its sovereign powers to "finance these developed actions and propose a clarified framework of work with the communities for a real plan of reception of the migrants."
