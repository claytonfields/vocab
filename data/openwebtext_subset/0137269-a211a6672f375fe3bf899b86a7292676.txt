A tipline for complaints against Kevin Spacey has been set up by the ​famed ​London theater where he served as artistic director for more than a decade.

“If you have been connected with The Old Vic or in our employment and feel you have a complaint that you were unable to raise, please contact us,” The Old Vic theater said in a statement Tuesday.

The theater, where Spacey worked between 2004 and 2015, said it is “deeply dismayed” by recent allegations against the “House of Cards” star — which include a claim that he groped a “young male” while both were on staff at the playhouse.

Spacey has also been accused of making sexual advances on Anthony Rapp in 1986 when he was 14.

The artistic director of another London theater said Monday that people in the local industry had “concerns” about Spacey for many years.

“I think that many people in the theater and in the creative industries have been aware of many stories of many people over a lot of years, and Kevin Spacey would be one of the people that people have had concerns about, yes,” said Victoria Featherstone, artistic director of London’s Royal Court Theatre.
