I saw that my gift was being sent from Amazon and had been patiently waiting, checking the post office daily. Today, I had a slip in the box saying I had a package. I had also ordered a new mp3 player recently and was expecting that as well. I picked up a few different packages and now I was really curious. The drive home was the longest ten minute drive! I was so excited! I ran in the house, packages in hand. I tore through the box like a rabid rodent I saw the 2 most perfect gifts. I have been wanting an mp3 speaker for months to use with my phone and in the box was the coolest one I had ever seen! That would have been enough to make me the happiest vaporrama ever but then there was also a cookbook with all sorts of awesome yummies to make! Deciding where to start is going to be the hardest part. Thank you so very much to my Secret Santa! You made me little kid on christmas happy!

Edit: I just discovered that there is a second box still in transit! What!! This is too much! I love you, Miss Secret Santa!! Will update asap XD

UPDATE: I went body boarding this morning before the post office opened so after I finished I went to check my mail box. The second package was there! Again the long 10 minute drive home and then tearing open the plastic. I screamed so loud when I saw what my match had gotten me that I scared all 3 cats! She got me the best t-shirt anyone has ever given me...my dear match, I LOVE YOU!!! Thank you so very much, you fucking ROCK!!!
