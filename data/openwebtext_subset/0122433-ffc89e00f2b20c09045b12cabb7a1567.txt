Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Thursday it would "be a sign of sickness" to return former President Bill Clinton to the White House following all the recent WikiLeaks revelations.

"Does the law apply to everyone, or are we a country that some people are above the law?" Gingrich asked during an interview on Fox News Channel's "Hannity." "Putting Bill Clinton back in the White House given everything that we're learning would be a sign of sickness."

Recent WikiLeaks documents included a 12-page memo from former Clinton confidant Doug Band in which he indicated he sought out paid-speaking engagements for the former president at the same time he headed up the Clinton Foundation charity.

Gingrich said the continued drip-drip-drip of revelations are why he believes current Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton will lose to Republican Donald Trump on November 8.

"In the end, I don't think the majority of American people are going to put somebody who is a liar and a crook in the White House," he said.

Gingrich pointed to Hillary Clinton's history with use of a private server while secretary of state from which 33,000 emails were wiped before handing the rest over to the State Department, and Bill Clinton meeting with Attorney General Loretta Lynch on a private plane just days before the FBI declined to prosecute.

"This is the kind of stuff that [happens] in a place like Venezuela," Gingrich said,. "because they don't have the rule of law."

WikiLeaks, he said, is "ripping the scar off of the largest amount of corruption in American history. This beats any prior corruption scandal I know of, including the 1868 period where Grant was president, including the Harding administration. I mean, including some of the things that happened under Truman."
