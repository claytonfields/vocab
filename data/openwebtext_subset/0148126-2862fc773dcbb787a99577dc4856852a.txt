Eulogy

Eulogy here was “inspired” by @AnthonyCDavison and something he posted to his Twitter. Many thanks to him for the joke, which gave me an outlet to create a strip around it since I’ve been going through peaks and valleys when it comes to inspiration. We’ve been doing this comic strip since the first of the year, and I’m finally starting to feel a little exhaustion or stress when it comes to ideas. There may be other comics in the future that have been inspired by something else, but I will do everything I can to make sure that credit is given where credit is due.

Every now and then an example of parallel thinking occurs, and that can be frustrating. I remember once, several years ago, I had been working on what I thought was a killer stand up routine on milk, to the point I performed it a few times and felt great about it. Literally a few days later, a special from Lewis Black came out and he did a solid 7 minutes on milk… a lot of the same general area that I had broached… but my god did he do it so much better. I threw the bit in the garbage and sulked. Thanks, Lewis.
