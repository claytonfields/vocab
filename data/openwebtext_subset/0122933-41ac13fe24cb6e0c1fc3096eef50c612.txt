Developer Renegade Kid says it is "discussing other options" following the failure of its Kickstarter for episodic first-person horror game Cult County.

The game raised less than ten percent of its targeted $580,000 goal, ending its month-long crowd-funding campaign with $46,736. Renegade Kid is best known as the creator of the Dementium series and titles such as Treasurenauts.

Cult County is described as "The Walking Dead meets Silent Hill 2 from a first-person perspective." The game is set in a "small, dusty West Texas town." In an interview with Polygon last month, company co-founder Jools Watsham said the game would progress, regardless of Kickstarter success. "We will make Cult County regardless of what happens with the Kickstarter campaign," he said. "It will take a lot longer for us to complete Cult County if the minimum goal is not reached, though."

"Cult County Kickstarter has ended. 1492 wonderful backers pledged $46,736. Thank you! We did not reach goal. Now discussing other options," stated Watsham on Twitter today. "People tell us we need to reduce the number of platforms and budget for Cult County. Only way to reduce budget is to only make Episode One."
