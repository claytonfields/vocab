British electro-soul musician James Blake is releasing his new LP The Colour in Anything tonight at midnight GMT, meaning listeners on the East Coast will be able to hear it just in time for a relaxing evening listen. It's Blake's third full-length and first since 2013's Overgrown, and it's his first substantive release since 2014's short 200 Press EP. (He wrote and performed on several songs that made up Beyoncé's recent "visual album" Lemonade.) Blake announced the release on Annie Mac's BBC Radio 1 show while premiering new music, specifically a Bon Iver collaboration called "I Need a Forest Fire" that's part of the tracklist. (It's embedded below.)

Blake has been teasing this album for over a year, and his promotional efforts have ramped up in recent weeks with the appearance of billboards in London and New York that bear the album's title. It was called Radio Silence at one point, and Blake went as far as to premiere a recorded version of a song with the same name on Mac's show last year. (An updated version is included in the embed below.) It's unclear whether or not "Radio Silence" and other recent releases — like the tracks "Modern Soul," "Timeless," and "RPG" — will be on The Colour in Anything's tracklist, but we won't have to wait long to find out: the album's out in just a few hours.

Update May 5th 4:25PM ET: Three of Blake's new songs — the two mentioned above and another called "My Willing Heart" are now available on Spotify.
