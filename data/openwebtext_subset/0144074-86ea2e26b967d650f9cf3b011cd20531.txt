Here’s the deal. I spend my money advertising my services (mostly with Google). I figured I’d try giving some of that money to Reddit instead and see what happens.

I worked at Lockheed Martin (7 years) and FLIR Systems (2 years) as a mechanical design engineer. I worked everything from cruise missiles to high-energy laser systems to test fixtures. I craved independence too much to keep that up forever, so for the last 3 years I’ve been flying solo.

Today I work with small businesses, inventors, and startups. I bring high-level talent and experience to projects that otherwise have limited options. I know how to work remotely and use modern web-based collaboration tools designed specifically for CAD projects. I understand the importance of documentation and revision control when developing, prototyping, and manufacturing components. I’m the guy you need, but can’t afford to hire full time.

If you need help with anything that relates to mechanical design, CAD, prototyping/3D printing, mechanism design, etc – schedule a call with me below. If I can’t help, maybe I can point you in the right direction. I love meeting new people and hearing about cool projects (that’s the best part of what I do!).

If you can’t find a time that works, that’s OK. Just Click Here and fill out my contact form. I’ll get back to you ASAP and we’ll take it from there.
