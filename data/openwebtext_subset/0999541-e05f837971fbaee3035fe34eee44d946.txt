The CSU volleyball team notched another road sweep Thursday night in one of its best all-around performances of the season.

The Rams swept New Mexico 3-0 (25-19, 25-20, 25-21) to move to 10-5 and 4-0 in Mountain West play.

The Colorado State University offense was nearly unstoppable on Thursday. The Rams hit .389 with the five main attackers all hitting .350 or better as freshman setter Katie Oleksak dished out 39 assists.

“That’s a tribute to her distribution,” CSU coach Tom Hilbert said. “We’re getting more comfortable. We’re growing through this offensively. We’ve got talented players in every spot. (Oleksak’s) finding ways to get it to them and quickly.”

Jasmine Hanna hit .423 and led the team with 12 kills. Sanja Cizmic, Kirstie Hillyer and Alexandra Poletto all had eight kills each, with Poletto adding seven blocks. Olivia Nicholson added seven kills.

New Mexico (10-8, 1-4 MW) hit just .074 and the Rams out-blocked the hosts 12-3. Other than serving (CSU had 11 serving errors and New Mexico had 10 aces), it was the best performance of the season from CSU.

The serving kept UNM in sets and Hilbert said that needs to be cleaned up ahead of a big showdown Saturday at UNLV.

“The biggest test is Saturday,” Hilbert said. “I’m excited for that one.”
