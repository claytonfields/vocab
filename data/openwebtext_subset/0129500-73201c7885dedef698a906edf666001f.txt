It was by no means a vintage Bolton Wanderers performance, but once again, there are a lot of positives to take from yesterday's win over Sheffield Wednesday. One of those was the myriad good individual performances, which makes the job of choosing man of the match a lot more difficult, but also a lot less boring. There are good cases to be made for Chris Eagles, he put in another huge performance providing creativity and got another assist; Mark Davies scored the winning goal, which was the cherry on top of a vastly improved game from him. However, in the end, I think our MOTM has to go to Jay Spearing.

Yesterday Jay Spearing provided Bolton's midfield with the sort of grit it hasn't seen in a long time. While overall, the team was a pretty good mess last season, many of the issues could be traced to the lack of tenacity in midfield, causing sloppy turnovers, poor defensive marking, and little positive offensive movement. However, if you fix one broken piece, the rest of the machine will start running again, and Spearing is on his way to doing that.

The Liverpool loan boy was an essential cog in that Bolton team, he showed competence and confidence when shutting down the opposition, providing some much needed assistance to the beleaguered back four. He also provided a number of good through balls, starting attacks, and giving Chris Eagles the base he needs to work off to really shine. For us, he really was indispensable yesterday. But who was your MOTM? Vote in the poll and tell us why in the comments!
