After missing Tuesday's game in New Orleans with right Achilles tendinitis and being listed as questionable for the previous several games, Rudy Gay has been removed from the lineup and will miss his second consecutive game Wednesday against the Houston Rockets (11-3).

Rudy's replacement, Omri Casspi, played extremely well in his absence. No. 18 scored 22 points and grabbed four rebounds in the team's impressive win over Anthony Davis and the New Orleans Pelicans.

Darren Collison will also miss his second consecutive game with a left quadriceps contusion/strain. Collison had tallied 30 assists and just five turnovers in his three games prior to injury.

Darren's backup, Ramon Sessions is again listed on the injury report with a right knee strain, but after playing in Tuesday's win in New Orleans and tallying 15 points and 6 assists, has been upgraded to probable.
