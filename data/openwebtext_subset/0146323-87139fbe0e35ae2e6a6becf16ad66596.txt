A military dog has allegedly been captured by the Taliban. According to the Washington Post, an individual who distributes Taliban propaganda posted a video to Twitter that shows the animal chained by armed Taliban fighters.

A Taliban spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid, told the Post that the dog carries the rank of colonel. "The dog was of high significance to the Americans," Mujahid told the newspaper. "The mujahideen valorously put tough resistance against the troops for hours."

According to the BBC, the men in the video say the dog was captured after a raid by U.S. forces in December last year in the eastern Afghan province of Laghman. The dog, likely a Belgian malinois, is equipped with a tactical vest, GPS device, flashlight, and camera.

According to CNN, U.S. officials say the canine soldier belongs to British special forces, and the BBC reports that British ISAF officials in Afghanistan confimed a military dog went missing in action during last December.

Both British and American forces use Belgian malinois in the battlefield to sniff for explosives. A Belgian malinois named Cairo became a minor celebrity when U.S. officials disclosed it had been part of the Navy SEAL raid that killed Osama bin Laden.
