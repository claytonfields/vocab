The Redskins announced on Tuesday that they have signed wide receiver David Gettis to a futures contract.

The 6-foot-3, 220-pound Gettis played collegiately at Baylor along with quarterback Robert Griffin III and backup center J.D. Walton, whom Washington signed late in the season.

Gettis entered the NFL in 2010 as a sixth-round pick by the Carolina Panthers.

Gettis missed the 2011 season with a torn anterior cruciate ligament and appeared in two games in 2012. Carolina released him in the preseason of 2013 on an injury settlement. Gettis is the eighth player signed by Washington to a futures contract in the past two weeks.

They signed seven — guard Tevita Stevens, punter Robert Malone, running back Davin Meggett, linebacker Gabe Miller, cornerback Ryan Mouton, tight end Richard Quinn and defensive back Peyton Thompson — to those contracts on Dec. 31.
