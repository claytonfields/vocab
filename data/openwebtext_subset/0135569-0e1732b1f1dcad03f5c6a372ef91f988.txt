It was nice to see the untold past of Ahsoka Tano, or the return of Thrawn to Star Wars canon at Celebration Europe this past weekend, but one new hero in particular stole the show for many: the funky looking ‘Space Monkey’ in the Rogue One sizzle reel. Well, in the true Star Wars tradition, we now know everything there is to know about him.

Thanks to the fine folks over at the Star Wars Show—or more specifically Lucasfilm story group executive Pablo Hidalgo, appearing on this week’s episode—we already know enough about Space Monkey to a) learn that he’s not called ‘Space Monkey’ and b) Probably give him a decent Wookieepedia page already (spoilers, he already has one).

Yes, as Pablo mentions in the video above, Space Monkey is actually named Bistan, and is a member of a species called the Iakaru. He’s a member of the Rebel Alliance too, and is actually a door gunner aboard a U-Wing—a new ship in the Rebel Fleet that we first got official glimpses of at Celebration Europe’s publishing panel, which gave us a look at the cover of a book called “Make Your Own U-Wing.”

It doesn’t look large enough to demand it’s own side-door gunners, but it apparently is! And Bistan is presumably one of many. Look forward to him probably getting at least three different action figures before Rogue One: A Star Wars Story hits theaters in December.
