The original manga revolves around high school boy Ry≈çta Murakami, who cannot forget his female childhood friend whom he let die in an accident. Feeling that he must fulfill their promise of proving the existence of aliens, he has continuously looked up at the sky as a member of the astronomy club.

Okamoto began the manga in Young Jump in 2011. Shueisha will release the sixth compiled volume of the manga on September 19.
