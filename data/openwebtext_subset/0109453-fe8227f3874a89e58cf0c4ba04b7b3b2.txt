The July issue of Houbunsha's Manga Time Kirara Carat magazine will announce on Monday that the high school edition of kakifly's K-ON manga will end in the next issue in June. Since April of 2011, the high school edition has been following Azusa, Ui, Jun, and the other characters who are still in high school after the other characters graduated. The college edition will end in the July issue of the main Manga Time Kirara magazine on June 9.

Kakifly's original four-panel comedy manga follows a group of high school girls who form an afterschool rock band. The manga had ended its first run in September 2010. Yen Press began publishing the manga in North America in November 2010.

K-ON!!, the second television anime series based on the manga, ran in Japan in 2010, and the K-ON! film premiered last December. Bandai Entertainment released the anime's first season in North America in 2011 before it stopped releasing new titles this past February.

Sentai Filmworks licensed the 26-episode anime sequel and the accompanying OVA. The company will begin releasing the series on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in North America on June 19. The K-ON! film will ship on Blu-ray Disc and DVD in Japan on July 18.
