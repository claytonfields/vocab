The minister responsible for Centrelink has been cleared of any wrongdoing following allegations he shared private information without consent.

The Australian Federal Police has told Human Services Minister Alan Tudge it will not be investigating the claims any further.

Labor asked the AFP in March to investigate whether Mr Tudge had broken the law when he released an individual's personal Centrelink details to the media.

"The Australian Federal Police will not be pursuing Labor's allegations that I broke privacy law," Mr Tudge said in a statement on Monday.

The AFP's assistant commissioner made it clear that the information released by my office and prepared by my department was approved for release and was therefore not an unauthorised disclosure, Mr Tudge said.

"The decision to end the consideration of this referral is no surprise."

Mr Tudge reiterated that the law allows for the release of limited information to respond to incorrect or misleading statements in the media about specific cases to maintain the integrity of government programs.

He branded Labor's referral as a political stunt and part of a "scare campaign".
