VRFocus catch up with Justin Ng from Gattai Game, a Singapore based company who have taken their award-winning student videogame previously known as Lurking into virtual reality (VR). This is a first-person mic-enabled sound-based stealth thriller. This narrative single player game uses sound to enable you to see but also allow enemies to hear you. VRFocus has covered this extensively in this preview here.

Inspired by an animation of a young blind girl who taps around her to see they locked down the art style and decided to make a VR game. With two to five hours of gameplay the game will be available for the PlayStation VR, Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. Gattai Game is composed of fresh grad students who have a few more ideas in the pipeline which are both VR and non-VR. VRFocus will keep you up to date of their endeavours.
