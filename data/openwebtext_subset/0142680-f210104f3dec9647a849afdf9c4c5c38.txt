Having registered 3 shutouts in 5 games, and with just 2 goals conceded, the joint-lowest in the top flight, Manchester City lead the bookies‚Äô defensive rankings with a 55% chance of keeping a clean sheet against Crystal Palace on Saturday afternoon. The Eagles sit rock bottom of the Premier League and have failed to score a goal in their opening 5 matches, so Pep Guardiola‚Äôs men are expected to bolster their already impressive defensive record. Nicolas Otamendi makes our starting XI after scoring in last weekend‚Äôs 6-0 romp at Vicarage Road, with his ¬£5.5m valuation also making him the cheapest route into the City back line.

Arsenal (47%) rank second for the gameweek ahead of their Monday night Emirates clash with West Brom. The Gunners have kept clean sheets in their last 2 outings, whilst the Baggies failed to score at home to West Ham last weekend, and are yet to find the net more than once in a league game this season. Sead Kolasinac has arrived in the Premier League and shown his attacking promise early on, registering 2 assists in his 4 appearances, to emerge as the highest scoring Arsenal defender after 5 gameweeks and starts for our side.

Chelsea (44%) and Manchester United (43%) complete a big-hitting defence for Gameweek 6. Antonio Conte‚Äôs men have started to show some of their infamous defensive solidity from last term, conceding just twice in their last 4 and keeping 2 clean sheets in that time. The Blues travel to Stoke this weekend. United, meanwhile, offer fantasy managers the best defence in the league, having conceded just twice (joint-lowest along with City) and registered 4 shutouts. A trip to Southampton, who have blanked in 3 of 5 games this season, bodes well for Mourinho‚Äôs men. The cheapest and securest combination from both sides sees us pair Thibaut Courtois with Phil Jones.

On the bench, Rob Elliott (¬£4.0m ‚Äì 33%) is once again our backup keeper when he travels to Brighton on Sunday afternoon, with the Magpies keeping 2 clean sheets in their last 3. Ben Mee (¬£4.5m ‚Äì 42%) welcomes Huddersfield, who have failed to score in 2 of their last 3 games, to Turf Moor, where the Clarets were notoriously resolute last season, on Saturday. Chancel Mbemba (¬£4.0m ‚Äì 33%) made a surprise early return from injury for Newcastle last time out and looks the likeliest ultra-budget defender to play this weekend.

Ahead of a plum home game against Crystal Palace, Sergio Aguero tops the bookies‚Äô attacking ranks, and takes our captain‚Äôs armband, with a 65% chance of finding the back of the net. The explosive Argentine been on fire lately, scoring a hat trick last weekend away to Watford, taking his tally to 5 in his last 3 in all competitions. With the Eagles having lost all 5 of their league games to date this season, things look ominous for Roy Hodgson‚Äôs charges on Saturday.

As a result of the bookies predicting an absolute rout at The Etihad, we go large on Pep‚Äôs attack and select Gabriel Jesus (62%) in a potentially deadly double-up (reminiscent of Suarez & Sturridge 2013/14) with Aguero. The Brazilian starlet has scored in each of his last 3 Premier League outings (4 goals). Alexandre Lacazette (55%) completes our front 3 this weekend, with Arsenal‚Äôs record signing taking on West Brom at The Emirates on Monday evening. Lacazette has scored in both of his home appearances for the Gunners this campaign, whilst the Baggies conceded 3 to Brighton‚Äôs weak attack on their last road trip.

Dele Alli (37%) is our first midfield pick for Gameweek 6. The former Milton Keynes player scored his third goal of the season in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday, regaining his goalscoring form ahead of an away game at West Ham in Saturday‚Äôs early kick off. The Hammers have turned the corner defensively of late with 2 clean sheets on the trot, but have still conceded an average of 2 goals per game in the league this season.

After spending big up front and in defence, we need to find some value in the middle of the park. This sees Alex Iwobi (30%) and Willian (29%) make our starting XI. Iwobi, who started last weekend for the Gunners, and who looks assured of another start this Monday with Danny Welbeck out injured and Mesut Ozil doubtful, forms part of an Arsenal attacking double up for our side. Willian, meanwhile, also looks assured starter with Pedro out injured. Opponents Stoke have conceded 6 goals in their last 3 games in all competitions, and with star defender Kurt Zouma ineligible to face the Blues as part of his loan agreement, Chelsea‚Äôs Brazilian could kickstart his season at The Bet365 Stadium on Saturday afternoon.

Two midfielders who face off at The Liberty Stadium complete our squad. Richarlison (27%) burst onto the Premier League scene with a goal and an assist in his first 2 matches, but has failed to produce fantasy points since. With Swansea losing both of their home games so far, and conceding 5 goals in the process, Saturday could provide the Brazilian with the opportunity to reignite his early season bandwagon. Tom Carroll (13%) will take to the field against Richarlison, but, as per usual, has to make do with the first spot on our substitutes bench, with his ¬£4.5m valuation and set piece duties making him the perfect enabler.

The bookies also fancy the chances of a number of higher priced midfielders, such as Arsenal duo Aaron Ramsey and Theo Walcott, Belgian big hitters Kevin de Bruyne and Eden Hazard, early season fantasy front runners Mohamed Salah and Henrikh Mkhitaryan, and the forgotten Kevin Mirallas, but for a variety of reasons (price, lack of starting security, squad selection restraints) we have to forgo all of the aforementioned players.
