If you haven’t heard by now, Tucker Carlson has replaced Megyn Kelly on FOX News and has evolved from a mainstream conservative into a borderline Alt-Lite personality:

“This shtick worked brilliantly for Carlson, catapulting him from a weekend hosting gig to the coveted 9 p.m. slot in Fox’s primetime lineup. He now regularly pulls in more than 3 million viewers a night—a marked improvement on the program he replaced—and he counts the commander in chief among his loyal fans. Just this past weekend, President Trump set off a minor international firestorm when he suggested Sweden was experiencing an immigrant-fueled spike in crime—a (dubious) claim he picked up by watching Tucker Carlson Tonight. …”

Case in point, the Sweden story.

It was all over sites like Infowars and Breitbart in the two weeks before Tucker Carlson picked it up. It went from there all the way up the rightwing media food chain to President Trump. We’ve become fans of the show in this household even though we consume far more more information from the internet than cable television. He’s reaching an audience which normally doesn’t watch FOX News.
