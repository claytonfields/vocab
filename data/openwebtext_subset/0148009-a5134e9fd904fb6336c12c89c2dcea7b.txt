The Wire creator David Simon is working on a new HBO series about the legalization and rise of the pornography industry in the 1970s and '80s.

Called The Duece, the TV series will see Simon team up again with his Wire and Treme partner George P. Pelecanos, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The HBO show will not only look at the porn industry in New York's Times Square, but it also will touch on the rise of HIV in Manhattan as well as the cocaine epidemic.

Simon and Pelecanos were reportedly unsure at first about proceeding with the project, which they heard about from a Treme location manager.

"George and I looked at each other and said, 'I don’t wanna make a porn show. … I’m married with kids and lawn furniture. I don’t want to go there, man. That’s dark,'” Simon said.

The Wire collaborators eventually agreed to look into the show and meet with a man who was on the mob front during the era, and from there, Simon and Pelecanos decided to move forward with The Duece. Though Simon admits hitting the right note with a show about porn isn't easy.

"You really have to land it in such a way where it’s a story about people and it’s a story about markets — about the moment where something became legal and profitable and what happens to people in that environment when markets prevail," he said.

HBO hasn't ordered a pilot for The Duece yet, though insiders believe one is coming. In the meantime, Simon has Show Me a Hero — starring Oscar Isaac of The Force Awakens — coming to the network in August.
