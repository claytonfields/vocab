RAMALLAH (Ma'an) -- Hundreds of Palestinians took part in a sit-in in solidarity with the Jordanian people after video emerged Tuesday of the Islamic State group executing a Jordanian hostage.

The rally in front of the Jordanian Representative Office in Ramallah came in response to the slaying of Maaz al-Kassasbeh, which has provoked outrage against ISIS in Jordan, Palestine, and across the Arab world.

Members of the central and executive committees of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian parliament, as well as representatives of Fatah, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and civil institutions and universities took part in the sit-in, where condolences were presented to the Hashemite Kingdom's representative in Palestine.

Jordan's ambassador to Palestine Khalid al-Shawabkeh addressed the crowd, saying: "Jordan, its King, its government, and its people will always stand against terrorism."

Al-Shawabkeh said that the killing of al-Kassasbeh would not stop Jordanian leadership from continuing to fight terrorism.

The ambassador also expressed gratitude to the Palestinian people and Palestinian leadership for showing solidarity with the Jordanian people.

The two main Palestinian political parties Fatah and Hamas have both condemned the killing of al-Kassasbeh.
