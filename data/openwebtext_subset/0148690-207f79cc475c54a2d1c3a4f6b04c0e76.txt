FOXBORO, Mass. â€” Although Danny Amendola and Michael Jenkins were taking the most reps at wide receiver during OTAs on Tuesday, Aaron Dobson made the play of the day.

The rookie wideout made a nice catch in traffic down the sidelines as the Patriots were going through their drills without pads and at three-quarters speed. Dobson was known for making spectacular catches in college at Marshall. It seems as though that part of his game as carried over to the pros.

It was tough to gather much from watching OTAs on Tuesday as the players were wearing jerseys without numbers, but Dobson, Jenkins and Amendola all looked comfortable early with Tom Brady.

At cornerback, Kyle Arrington and Aqib Talib were getting the most action at the position outside. Ras-I Dowling looked healthy and smooth out on the far practice field. As long as Dowling can stay healthy, he could be a contributor on defense for the Patriots. The trouble for the Virginia product throughout his short two-year career has been injuries, though.

Rob Gronkowski, Brandon Bolden, Brandon Spikes and Julian Edelman were among those not spotted during the second OTA of the season. T.J. Moe, Mark Harrison, Sebastian Vollmer, Josh Boyce and Kamar Aiken all spent some time on the stationary bikes and doing some light jogging around the field. Harrison signed with the Patriots on Monday, but had an existing foot injury. Boyce was drafted with a foot injury.
