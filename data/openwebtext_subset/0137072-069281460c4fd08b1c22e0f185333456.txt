Heavyweight Bobby Lashley will finally get a chance at redemption when he faces James Thompson in a June 19 mixed martial arts rematch on the main card of Bellator 138 at the Scottrade Center in St. Louis.

The 6-foot-3, 265-pound Lashley (12-2), owner of American Top Team Altitude martial arts center in Denver, is on a five-match winning streak since losing a unanimous decision to Thompson (20-14) in 2012. They were originally scheduled to fight in February, but that was postponed after Lashley withdrew because of an injury.

Lashley, 38, was a three-time NAIA national wrestling champion for Missouri Valley College at 177 pounds from 1996-98. He rose to fame after entering the professional wrestling ranks with World Wrestling Entertainment in 2004. He still works in the industry, now with Total Nonstop Action, where he became a two-time TNA world heavyweight champion.

Headlining the Bellator 138 card is a heavyweight fight between Kimbo Slice and UFC Hall of Famer Ken Shamrock, who is competing in his first MMA bout in more than four years. The main card will be televised on Spike at 7 p.m.
