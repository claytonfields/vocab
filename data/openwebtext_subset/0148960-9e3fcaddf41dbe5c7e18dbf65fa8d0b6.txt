The 6-foot-3-inch tall Jeb Bush inexplicably stood on his tiptoes for a group photo op before Wednesday night’s Republican presidential primary debate.

So Fox News’ Bill Hemmer tried to get to the bottom of it when he debriefed with the former Florida governor Thursday morning on “America’s Newsroom.”

“Were you looking for someone?” Hemmer asked. “Or were you looking to be a little taller than the guy there at your right?”

Bush stood next to his chief rival, Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump, in the photo. But he insisted that he just made himself taller to catch his wife’s eye out in the audience.

“I was looking over to the press to see where my wife was sitting because she’s the love of my life and just I need to have eye contact with her before we started,” Bush explained. “You’ve been married 42 years that’s the kind of thing you do.”
