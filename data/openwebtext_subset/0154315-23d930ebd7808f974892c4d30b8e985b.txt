PORTAGE PARK â€” Mayor Rahm Emanuel Wednesday remembered International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 134 Business Manager Terry Allen as a champion of the middle class.

Allen, who died Tuesday of prostate cancer, was the brother of former Ald. Tom Allen (38th) and the brother-in-law of Ald. Tim Cullerton (38th).

Allen's death means "Chicago has lost a tireless champion of middle-class values and a true friend," Emanuel said.

Allen carried on a long family tradition of service to Chicago, Emanuel said.

Cullerton announced Allen's death of his Facebook page, where he praised "his little brother" for fighting a "heroic battle against cancer."

"There will never be another quite like him," Cullerton said. "Please keep our family in your prayers."

Allen took over the electrical workers union, one of the city's largest, in 2011.

Union leaders picked Don Finn Wednesday to take Allen's position.
