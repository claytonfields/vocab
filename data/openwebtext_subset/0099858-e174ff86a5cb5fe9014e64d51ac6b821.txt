A Derry man who smashed a window “head-butted his own reflection”, Derry Magistrates Court heard today.

The court was told Gerard McGaughey, of Rosskeen Park, was drunk when he committed the offence in a city centre bar on May 2, causing over £500 of damage.

The court was told he could not remember what happened.

“The whole sorry incident is captured on CCTV,” defence solicitor Seamus Quigley told the court.

“The prosecution suggest he turned around and was almost spooked by his own reflection in the door.

“If the prosecution theory is correct, he may be fortunate that he is not charged with attempted assault.”

McGaughey pleaded guilty to criminal damage and was ordered to pay £548.40 compensation to the bar and was given a two year conditional discharge.
