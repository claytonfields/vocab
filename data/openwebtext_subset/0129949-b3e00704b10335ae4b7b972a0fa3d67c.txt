On October 6, Minnesota’s beer scene lost a legend.

Hans “Hanszee” Lofgren, a decades-long veteran of the local beer industry who worked for Capitol Beverage and Original Gravity, died unexpectedly at the age of 52.

Hanszee built countless friendships throughout his years of selling beer in Twin Cities and beyond. A mentor to many, a friend to all, Hanszee impacted people’s lives in positive ways from the very first moment they met him. His gregarious, genuine personality belied his formidable appearance, and his ability to make other people feel valued endeared him to so many.

In honor of Hans, we asked his friends and colleagues to share some of their thoughts and stories about the man who will be so sorely missed.

•••

Hans was a friend, a brother, a mentor, and a co-worker. He was larger than life in everything he did. He loved beer and he loved people and it showed in everything he did. His passing leaves a hole in our industry, our community, and our hearts. Many people have offered their condolences, kindly saying “I am sorry for your loss.” The reality is, this is a loss for all of us. We lost a big heart. He made everyone’s lives better by being in them, including mine. Hans is my friend. Hans is our friend. We have all learned a lot from Hans. Remember it all and celebrate it all the same way he would.

I had the pleasure of getting to know Hans at a beerfest in St. Cloud in the late 2000s. After getting past is imposing exterior, he instantly made you feel comfortable. In 2012, we turned over our distribution rights to Capitol Beverage Sales. Hans and the Morrisseys welcomed us into their portfolio, but also into their families. I was fortunate to spend so much time with Hans on our business. We became great friends enjoying time together outside of work. He was compassionate and generous, working to help to raise money and awareness for Valley Outreach in Stillwater, Wishes & More, and countless other amazing causes. Hans was a connector: even if he couldn’t help, he always knew someone who could. He built a vast network of loyal friends. He had a special place for local, small, unique, and knew what quality was. He left nothing on the table, living life fully. Above all, Hans loved Monica, Soren, and Frances.

Hans left a mark on everyone he met, I am lucky to have met him, and he has made a deep impact on my life. Rest in peace, my friend. Cheers.

Hanszee was one of the first people I met in the beer industry, almost 10 years ago. Even back then, he was introduced to me as one of the legendary figures of craft beer in Minnesota. I liked him from the moment I met him, and though we didn’t get a chance to work together, I always loved running into Hanszee at accounts, events, and festivals. He helped make the Minnesota craft beer industry into a fellowship of passionate, knowledgeable, and kind people.

Hans Lofgren was the Consummate Beerman since the 1990s. He successfully transformed himself into the face of the craft beer boom in Minnesota. Through it all, he earned the respect of his family, church, company, community, and everyone that knew him!

In an intense industry and complicated world, Hanszee was always a calm and comforting presence. Always. He was a ray sunshine and a breath of fresh air. No matter where you stood or on which side, he was a teammate. You knew you had a friend and supporter in Hanszee.

Hans lead by example in showing up. Whether it be for special events, for an important life moment, or just to check in to say hi and I’m here with you, Hanszee was not one to say I can’t make it or I’m too busy.

My favorite memory of the legend that we all knew and loved was the first time I realized what the true personality of Hanszee was. He found out that I was out of work in the beer business and was looking for a new gig. I had only met him a few times at this point and only as a competing beer rep. Our experience together at the time was short and sweet but immediately we both had great respect for each other as beer guys. He made a call to the owner of another distributor unbeknownst to me, telling him that they should hire me for a recently created position. Maybe a week after losing one job, I was hired for the new craft beer position as Capitol Beverage—in huge part, because of Hanszee’s recommendation. Hans soon followed suit and began working with us as the new Original Gravity. The rest is history and I got the privilege of working with him for the next three years. The best part about my quick story is that there are hundreds more just like it! He was a true mentor and friend and will forever be missed by many.

Many people have already said it how Hans was a great guy and all of the stories are true. He seemed to always be happy and people enjoyed being around him. The beer business can get competitive, but he was always respectful. It would be a great world if more people could be like Hans. He will be missed by many.

He was one of the best men I have ever known, he always had a smile and a hug and time to chat. Spent Christmas Eve with him and his Family for many years, I will miss him in his Santa suit and singing The 12 Days of Christmas.

Three years ago when I quit my “craft-brewery job” to reinvent myself (ha, ha), I was home with the kids on a warm summer day when I heard my then-six-year-old say, “Dad, there’s a huge pickup truck in our driveway!” She sounded concerned so I hurried around to the front of the house. Of course there was no need to despair, it was just Hanzee. He sensed that maybe I was a bit lonely and rudderless at that point in my life and could use a friend, so there he was. And of course he didn’t come empty-handed. He had a case of Budweiser in vintage-can packaging (!), along with a half-dozen reusable plastic Budweiser party cups for me to enjoy. He had just stopped by to say hi, crack a beer, and spread a little joy. Classic Hanzee. There will be never be another man like him.

It’s very hard to sum up how many great memories we’ve had with Hans. He helped teach me about beer and get to know so many other amazing people in the beer industry. After a Minnesota Wild game on New Year’s Eve, Rob and I went up to Old Chicago Roseville to grab a pint and some food. Hanszee messaged me and invited us over to have some beers with him, Monica, and the kids, and ring in the New Year. It was so sweet of him to open his home to us and let us be apart of his family’s New Year’s Celebration. Had so many great laughs and heard so many fun stories. He always made you feel like you were the most important person in the room and had some of the best stories!

It hurts to lose someone who was such a positive force in the world. My last beers with Hans were in St. Paul, sitting in the sun, watching a sidewalk of people flowing by us, and talking about life, family, fun, and work. He cared about living a full life and was a such a great mentor to so many in the community. An inspiration and a friend I’ll always remember.

One of my favorite memories about Hans was how much he cared for others. He’d buy me a beer and ask me about what I was up to. He wasn’t buttering me up to make a sale (I don’t have a retail operation); he truly cared and wanted to listen. I’ll miss having a guy that genuine to drink beer and talk with.

Hans, Monica, and their family embraced us as neighbors from the beginning. We lived next to the Lofgrens for seven years and so as you can imagine there are countless memories. He was the neighbor who helped you haul your leaves, snow plowed your driveway when you were on vacation, and insisted on driving us to the airport because he thought it was a waste of money to park there.

He cared a great deal about those close to him and was such a thoughtful and generous man. He always had a new beer for me to try, curious of my opinion on it. He took me to, or invited me to, countless events and brought me into his world. Hans introduced me to so many fantastic people, connecting us as friends. I’ll always be truly grateful for that.

The late-night talks on the back patio are what I have missed and will miss the most. We talked about beer (of course), politics, sports, and our families. Hans loved his family and was so proud of his kids, Soren and Frances, his wife Monica, and his parents. He was also proud of so many of you out there in his life. I’m very thankful that I knew that side of Hans and that I’ll always cherish these memories of him.

I met Hans almost 13 years ago when I first started working in the Minnesota beer industry. First selling against him, as I heard all the stories from the local bar owners around town of who he was and how his handles were off limits so don’t even ask about them, to later working with him when we launched our brand in Minnesota back in 2011. Hans taught me a lot about the business that we all enjoy but more so about life. Hans taught not by telling you how or why you should do something, but rather by showing you how to enjoy the little things you experienced each day. There was never a day that I didn’t walk into his office or meet him out in the market that he didn’t have a smile from ear to ear on his face. I can truly say that I am better person today for the things that he taught over the years and it is an honor to have been able to call him my friend.

I learned from my early traveling to breweries and Craft Brewers Conferences with Hans that he was well known, respected, and loved. Faces would light up with a smile when they saw him. Conversation followed about families and craft beer. I’ll greatly miss these travels and conversations with Hans. He taught me a lot about the beer business. He was a great ambassador of craft beer, but more importantly a great father, husband, and friend. You’ll truly be missed and never forgotten. RIP, my friend.

I am fortunate to say on Wednesday, October 4 I enjoyed a few last pints with Hanzee at one of his favorite spots in St. Paul, Half Time Rec. As always, it was a great conversation with lots of laughs. Hans mentioned how he always appreciated how everyone at Odell has always treated him like family, and in turn he felt like he was a direct part of our company. The truth is, Hans just treated everyone in his life like direct family. We were the ones that felt a part of his. When my wife Jadie and I moved from Fort Collins, Colorado, to St. Paul, Minnesota, Hans was the first to embrace us. Not like a business partner, but as best friends. He is the most passionate person I have met about his home state and the city of St. Paul specifically. We could not have had a better friend to show us this beautiful state and all the great things it has to offer.

Hans hired me to run Capitol Beverage’s Minneapolis On Premise Craft Route about seven years ago. He became a lifelong friend.

My favorite Hanszee moment isn’t one specific time, but rather a culmination of a lot of time spent together. Hans taught me how to build relationships and how important it is to take a minute and generally get to know and care about those you interact with on a daily basis. Whether it be the bar owner, bar back, wait staff, bus person, or the regular sitting at the bar. This was always evident everywhere we went as he’d done it for many, many years. We’d schedule a meeting and it would be interrupted over and over again because everybody wanted to get a moment of his time to catch up. Our 20-minute meetings turned into two- to three-hour affairs.

I was very nervous when I received a phone call from him for my interview at Capitol. I was even more nervous when I arrived and this big burly dude comes to get me for my interview. I had heard of him and knew of his importance to the beer industry. I hadn’t heard anything about his personality. I thank God that his compassion and calming personality came through as I was so nervous my voice was trembling. His witty humor and hearty, raspy laugh settled me right down.

I’ll forever call myself one of Hanszee’s guys and I’ll never forget his infectious personality. My wife Nicki will miss those big, wet, beer-filled bearded kisses as well. I’m honored to have learned from him and we’ll miss him forever.

I’m one of those many people in our industry who wasn’t particularly close to Hans, but was nonetheless devastated by his death. Hans was so generous with his time and advice; from the first time I met him, he took an interest in me, what I was trying to do, what made me tick. And from then on, every time I ran into him, he took time to talk, share, etc. I remember one time I stopped in randomly to Blackbird and Hans was there. He immediately stopped what he was doing to chat and share some (fantastic) beer. I know he did this with countless people. He was such a genuine person. He loved beer, and he loved all of us beer people.

Hanszee was a gentle giant in the Minnesota beer scene, not only in physical stature, but also in personality and reputation. He always greeted friends with his large smile, booming voice, firm handshake, and a laugh that was unmistakable across the grounds of whichever beer fest we were prepping for. I remember him for his keen sense of rock-and-roll style, singular to him. Man, he wore some cool rings. I once complimented him on a beer shirt he was wearing, and then he bought the matching shirt as a gift the next time he visited the brewhouse. His generosity and authenticity made him one of the greatest craft beer reps in the business and he’ll be deeply missed by his colleagues. Rest in peace, brother Hanszee. See you on the other side, my friend. I’m betting that you’ll have some beer chilled when we get there.

No matter where I was in my professional life Hans was always a support to me. My favorite memory with Mr. Hanszee was when I worked for the brewery, I did an event at Kelly’s Tap House and Grill in Red Wing and discovered their 41-tap challenge (as at this time they had 41 beers on tap.) As I’m drinking my way through the challenge I was posting on social media, and by the time I got to the 11th or 12th beer who walks through the door, Mr. Hans Lofgren himself. He walked over, sat down, and said, “I saw you doing this on Facebook and had to see it myself.” He stayed and drank with me while I completed the challenge, and honestly if he didn’t I don’t think I would’ve finished it. He didn’t take part in the festivities that night, so we always talked about doing it again together and were planning for this November. To you, Hanszee, yes sir “one of these day we will ride again.”

Hanszee was larger than life. He did everything with passion and kindness. All you have to do is look at the many people that have memorialized him on social media and you will see his reach was far. He put his all into his family, his community, his job, and of course his beer. He lived each day in the moment. As we go on with our lives, take a piece of Hans with you and make sure to care for each individual you meet and of course that your glasses are beer clean!

Cheers my friend.

Class. Respect. Jovial. This was Hanszee. I remember running into Hans when I first started slinging beer in a town that wasn’t welcoming to strangers. In a town whose backyard was my biggest competitor. I felt defeated nearly every day at the beginning. One afternoon this beast of a guy walks up to me, probably the most intimidating guy in the room, and extends his large mitt. He had the warmest biggest smile and instead of kicking my a$$, he offered to buy me a beer and wanted to hear my story. Immediate respect given to me when it wasn’t even deserved. It didn’t take long to realize that Hanszee was really a big teddy bear. His passion and gregarious personality were infectious. Yes, there is no doubt that he is legend in the beer world. But, most importantly he was an amazing person, someone we all desire to be and friend to all.

Hans was my friend at a base level. He was the most friendly, happy, smart, communicative person I know.

My favorite memories are of Hans and Monica in Duluth hanging out with me, and Hans talking about every possible beer subject under the sun as Monica sat with us and endured the hours of talk with a smile on her face and her hand on his arm. They are awesome and Hans leaving does not change that, except it sucks and is not right. Much love.

Hanszee was an inspiration to me. Not only professionally, but he really helped define what it meant to be a genuine, and generous human being. Always willing to go the extra three miles, regardless of how well he knew you. I, for one, will continue to carry his torch and be sure that his legacy, and commitment to helping others, lives on. Rest in peace, my friend. I’ll miss you. Thank you for being…you.

I had the pleasure of connecting with Hanzee in many contexts. At every encounter, Hanzee was in a positive mood, thoughtful beyond what I expected, and generous with good suggestions I had not previously considered. He was behaving like we all should.

Selflessness, thoughtfulness, and kindness are the first words that come to mind when I think about Hans. I had the good fortune of meeting him in early 2011 after having just joined the craziness we all know as the Minnesota craft beer industry. I had no idea why the Furious line was pouring foam at one of our largest draft accounts in Minneapolis. He showed me exactly what was wrong and taught me how to fix it before even asking my name. He saw a lost and confused rookie working for a competitor but didn’t hesitate to provide guidance. Quickly he did ask my name and said he was glad to be able to help. In the 6 odd years since that day I have only known him to be the decent and kind man he was the day I met him. He was good, to everyone. Heroes aren’t forgotten, but legends never die. Cheers to Hanszee, you will be dearly missed by all who knew you.

There have been so many heartfelt and grateful missives posted online since his passing. I’ve read each one with a bittersweet affect, touched by the way he positively impacted so many, and saddened by the loss so many now feel. I have this small piece to add: before Capital was selling craft, despite having a diligent sales rep, I bought zero draft beer from them. When my rep finally had something to offer (Red Hook Copperhook), he and Hanszee came by, sampled us out, and we brought it in—the first new draft I offered after taking the reins as a manager. Regardless, before, during, and after I was a customer, even when I’ve worked for competitors—Hanszee always treated me with sincerity and respect. He will be missed.

Hans taught so many people so many important things, not just about the beer industry, but about how to get along with other human beings in this world. Hans wasn’t just a beer salesman. He was a diplomat, and an ambassador for entire generations of men and women who followed in his massive footsteps. Hans Lofgren was one of the best in the business, but more importantly he was a caring father, a loving husband, a reliable friend, an enlightened mentor to many, and a good guy.

I got a text from Mayor Coleman when he heard the news. He put it just about as well as anyone could: “He was just one of those guys that always made your day better when you saw him.”

Rest easy, big fella.

These are just a few of the innumerable stories about Hans; there are so many more still to be told. So take a page from Hans’ book: Buy a beer for someone, share stories and words of encouragement, and leave the world a little richer in joy and friendship.

An education fund has been set up for Hans and Monica’s children. Seventh Street Truck Park is holding a “Hundos for Hans” event on November 4 to also raise money for the Lofgren family.
