It's quite an adorable aberration.

A rare two-headed kitten named "Deucy" was born in Amity, Ore., on Tuesday. The feline has four eyes, two noses and two mouths.

Her owner, Stephanie Durkee, didn't believe her kids when they told her what they found in the litter.

"The kids actually found them and came in and said, 'mom there's a kitty with two heads,' and I said, 'I think you guys are just tired, you're crazy, that doesn't happen,'" Durkee said.

After an examination, vets say the kitten appears to be in good health, despite being rejected by her mother. She's now being fed kitten formula with a syringe.

Cats born with the rare condition are known as 'Janus cats', after the Roman god with two faces.
