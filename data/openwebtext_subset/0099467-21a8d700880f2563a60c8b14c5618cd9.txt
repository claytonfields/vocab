Rihanna Paying UFO Watcher In Mohave Desert To Update Her On Alien Activity?

The 'Diamonds' singer is said to be convinced aliens will land on Earth during her lifetime.

Rihanna has reportedly started paying a UFO watcher out in America to keep an eye on the skies for alien activity.

The 'We Found Love' singer is alleged to have a keen interest in potential Extra Terrestrial activity, and is said to be paying a sky scanner out in the Mojave desert to give her updates.

"Rihanna has always been convinced aliens will land on Earth in her lifetime," a source told the Daily Star this week. "So she's started using the man, who calls himself a sky scanner, to give her information from Nevada on anything that relates to sightings.

"This isn't a fad for Rihanna, she's a total believer and doesn't mind spending her money on it to get results," they claim.

The 'Diamonds' singer is currently out in New York City, while fresh claims suggest she and Chris Brown split earlier this year over their differing views on raising a family.
