In the span of a few hours, two former LA Galaxy keepers have moved on.

This morning Jon Kempin was traded to Columbus for a fourth round pick (90th overall) in the 2018 MLS SuperDraft. The Galaxy then chose to pass on a listless Waiver Draft in which only two selections were made.

Here’s my #waiverdraft recap for those who blinked and missed it: Colorado picked Kip Colvey, Montreal picked Clement Diop.

Unfortunately, one of those picks was Senegalese national goalkeeper Clement Diop, a native French speaker who should feel at home in Montreal. Despite showing glimpses of quality, the acrobatic shot-stopper never managed to find the consistency required to warrant extended playing time, suffering a decline in form this past season.

You have to feel for Jon Kempin, who did a decent job in limited minutes, pitching two shutouts in seven starts and becoming just the fifth keeper in league history to save multiple PKs in the process.

Currently LA do not have a single goalkeeper on the first team roster, with the potential to land several options in the upcoming Re-Entry Draft (Including Brian Rowe).

Good luck Jon and Clement!
