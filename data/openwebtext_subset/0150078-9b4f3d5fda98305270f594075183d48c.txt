Here's a question to think about: How many teams that won a playoff series last season will win a playoff series this season?

The playoffs went to four rounds in 1975. Since 1976, only once (2001) has their been more than five teams in the conference semifinals that weren't there the year before. On average, 4.5 of the eight teams in the conference semis were also there a year earlier.

This year could buck the trend.

Two teams that won series last year -- Brooklyn and Indiana -- are currently out of the playoffs in the Eastern Conference. Their best-case scenario is a first-round exit at the hands of the Hawks or Cavs. Two others -- Miami and Oklahoma City -- are currently 7 or 8 seeds, fighting for postseason berths. Three more -- the Clippers, Spurs and Wizards -- are 5 or 6 seeds.

That leaves the Portland Trail Blazers as the only team that won a playoff series last year and is currently in position to hold home-court advantage in the first round.

We could definitely have four new conference semifinalists in the Eastern Conference. And there's a decent chance for three new ones -- Golden State, Houston and Memphis --in the West. Seven new teams winning playoff series would be unprecedented.

Alas, the postseason is still 26 days away, and there's still some business to take care of. No team has been taking care of business better than the Warriors, who have won 10 of their last 11 games and got their revenge on the Hawks last week.

• Last week: Cavs keep pushing with a month to go

• This time last year: East powers looking more vulnerable -- The Sixers' losing streak was at 24 games, the Knicks were three games out of a playoff spot after winning eight straight, Steve Nash came off the bench in a game for the first time in 14 years, and Kevin Durant hit a ridiculous game-winner in Toronto.



• Plus-minus stud: Chris Paul (LAC) was a plus-71 in four games last week.

• Plus-minus dud: Al Horford (ATL) was a minus-65 in three games last week.



• Hero Team of the Week: Phoenix (3-0) -- The Suns stayed alive by beating the Rockets (on the road) and Mavs over the weekend.

• Zero Team of the Week: Indiana (0-4) -- The Pacers went down to the wire in Cleveland (where the Cavs have won 15 straight) on Friday, but lost their other three games by an average of 16 points.



• High jumps of the week: Phoenix (+6), Brooklyn (+4), Chicago (+3), Miami (+3)

• Free falls of the week: Indiana (-9), Portland (-5), Milwaukee (-4)



• East vs. West: The West is 249 - 175 (0.587) against the East in interconference games and was 18-11 last week. The Bulls (17-13), Pistons (9-21), Pelicans (16-14) and Jazz (15-15) are done with their interconference schedules.



• Toughest schedules through Sunday: 1. L.A. Lakers, 2. Sacramento, 3. Minnesota

• Easiest schedules through Sunday: 1. Washington, 2. Golden State, 3. Indiana

Schedule strength is based on cumulative opponent record, and adjusted for home vs. away and days of rest before a game.
