Obama’s speech aside, why don’t Republicans want for America the world’s best, state of the art infra-structure–high speed trains and the 75 industries that would design and build the systems, attracting revenue and growth to sustain the economy and families? Why don’t they want the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, whose news roundups let European and Asian travelers and business people feel at home–and give Americans a peek at the world beyond our coasts? Why build weapons systems the Forces line out, but are restored in each budget cycle?

The Times reports 2,000 mental health patients released by a major service provider due to cuts and privatization in Salt Lake City. We know the House-passed Farm bill leaves the SNAP safety net on the table without a promise of passage.

Where, as the President asked, is the GOP’s economic plan? Is it spending cuts and repealing Obamacare?

The impressive growth of 7 million new jobs, doubling domestic oil production, providing stimulus to states to protect essential services, creating the largest crackdown on fraud in Medicaid’s history, securing a escrow trust for the Gulf oil spill victims–how much more could be done if the GOP reached out, taking credit for leadership and innovation?

Yet the GOP persists in blame and labels.They agreed–before the speech–to use the hashtag,#SpeechesDontHire, Is that their best response? To plan an attack with a generic putdown before the speech was heard? Their fault finding never has a fix.
