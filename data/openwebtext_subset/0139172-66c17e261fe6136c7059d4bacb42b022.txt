SS+ will no longer be updated going forward. The number of worthwhile features within it has dwindled, which can just be included in other mods. Crew salaries and probably vengeance fleets will be gone altogether. Nexerelin will likely take the officer death and battle map enhancements. Dynasector will improve the named bounty system. SWP will have the few remaining vanilla balance changes.

You can lob a massive amount of lrms across the map on a target, even a lone Achilles can take down without a scratch big meanies like the Dominator. It remind me a bit of Kadur's ships, low tech missiles boats that can swarm the screen with lrms. It's pretty much unstoppable unless you are largely outnumbered.



I have yet to try a missile based fleet with those in the campaign but i'm pretty sure it will be very powerful. That's going to be fun. Logged

If you have proper shielding and/or point defense systems, dealing with a fire-support Achilles is not a problem.



I had to do several takes with the Achilles to get it to succeed against that frigate fleet, by the way. It's really easy to mess up and get creamed since it has terrible armor coverage. Logged

Integrated and updated arcibalde's Vanilla Addon mod (over 400 new variants!)

NPC fleets now have randomized skills, aptitudes, crew veterancy, and a flagship

Added Small Unit Tactics, Wing Command, and Logistical Oversight skills to the Leadership skill tree

Added Engine Power Limiter, Expanded Flight Decks, Cargo Expansion, Extended Fuel Tanks, Additional Crew Quarters, Minimized Logistics, and Maximized Ordinance hull mods

Revamped character creation difficulty settings; start in a shuttle, a frigate, a destroyer, or a cruiser + small fleet

Balance changes! After much toil and trouble, I have finished the next update. No new ships or weapons, but there is a lot of content nonetheless. Logged
