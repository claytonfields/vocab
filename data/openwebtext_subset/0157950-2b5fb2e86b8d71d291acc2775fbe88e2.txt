Actor and Obama administration aide Kal Penn was robbed early Tuesday morning in Washington.

(CNN) â€“ White House aide Kal Penn, the once and future actor, was robbed at gunpoint in Washington early Tuesday morning, according to two officials familiar with the matter.

Penn had his wallet and cell phone stolen, but officials stressed that he was not seriously injured in the incident that was initially reported by TMZ.com.

"He's fine," said one of the officials, who added that Penn reported for work at the White House. He works in the Office of Public Liaison and focuses on President Obama's outreach to the Asian-American and Pacific Islander communities.

Penn starred in the movie "Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle" and recent reports have suggested he is itching to turn his attention back to acting soon.

White House officials referred all calls about the incident to the Metropolitan Police Department of Washington. A police spokesman said he could not comment on a law enforcement matter.
