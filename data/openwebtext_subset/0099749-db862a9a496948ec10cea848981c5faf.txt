The Los Angeles Times published an in-depth interview with Jesse Eisenberg about his Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice role, and it has some interesting new details.

When asked about Lex Luthor’s different hair styles in the movie, Eisenberg replied “when you see the movie, you’ll see. It’s the greatest scene that I’ve ever gotten to take part in — it accounts for the change in hair.”

That’s high praise! Eisenberg also revealed that fans will see Lex Luthor’s backstory in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.

“The character has a core of reality,” Eisenberg explained. “[Luthor] has a back story that’s tragic and an emotional inner life that’s authentic. That’s in the movie. It was my interest in playing the character with a real emotional core, and this writer, Chris Terrio’s interest in creating a character that seemed viable in reality.”

Zack Snyder told The Los Angeles Times that he originally offered Eisenberg a different role (he wouldn’t say which), and Eisenberg declined. He then went back to Eisenberg with the Lex Luthor offer, which he obviously accepted.

“I feel like once [Eisenberg] found out who Lex was he embraced it,” Snyder said. “Once you kind of start digging into Lex, it’s a bit of a scary thing to be that guy. I don’t think he just goes ‘Oh, I’ll just be that guy and then when I go home I’m not him.’ I think the thing with Jessie is he wasn’t immune to the reality of playing a super-scary character.”
