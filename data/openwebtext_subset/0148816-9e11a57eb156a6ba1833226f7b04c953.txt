I bought this lens last year and I must admit I haven’t used it all that much so far. This is mainly due to the fact that for the kind of work I do it is a little bit cumbersome as it requires manual focusing and doesn’t fit into my workflow easily. As far as focussing is concerned – it has a very smooth long travel gearing which does allow for very fine focus adjustments. The barrel is very smooth and as its a Metal lens it feels like a quality bit of kit with a good weight.

The lens has a very nice “Velvety” bokeh and a diffusion in the focussed areas when wide open. This I am told is not out of focus but rather a diffused effect. It is not something one can replicate in photoshop as it is not blur…it is a rather unique aspect to this lens alone.

To really utilise this lens to its best the subject has to be in the centre of the frame as that is the area that remains in focus so if you like to offset things you are photographing then you will have to place the subject in the centre and crop afterwards as I have done on the following images (albeit the subject was not dead centre):

Here is an example of a model full length at around f2.8 to give you an idea of why its not so good for Fashion:

It is however very ethereal for abstract imagery:

On the whole it is an interesting and characterful lens that has some interesting potential applications for creative use. I am sure there are people out there that would find this a very pleasing and interesting tool.

I have included a few images that give you some idea of the transition in the diffused areas of the frame shot at F11, F5,6, F2.8 and F1.6 respectively below:
