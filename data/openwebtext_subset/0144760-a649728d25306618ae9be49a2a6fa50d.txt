A trip to a fine arts museum can be painfully boring for some, but that’s nothing compared to the torture found at Spanish civil war jail cells.

In 2003, Spanish art historian Jose Milicua claimed he found evidence suggesting prisons during the civil war were inspired by modern art. This wasn’t to educate the prisoners on the humanities, but rather, used as a form of torture.

According to Milicua, the cells were built in 1938 to house republican forces fighting General Franco’s Fascist national Army. Court documents from French anarchist Alphonse Laurencic’s 1939 revealed the prisons were even inspired by the works of Salvador Dali and Wassily Kandinsky.

So what does a modern art jail look like? The cells, which were constructed in Barcelona, featured 20-degree angle sloping beds that made it impossible to sleep on. The floor, meanwhile, had oddly-placed bricks that kept people from ever walking forwards or even backwards.

The trial papers added that the walls were painted with surrealist patterns illuminated by lighting effects to make prisoners dizzy and confused. Other fixtures included a stone seat that can never be sat on, and walls with tar that make it unbearably hot during summer.

And to top it off, the prisoners were also forced to watch Salvador Dali and Luis Bunuel’s surrealist film Un Chien Andalou, wherein one morbid scene depicts an eyeball being slashed open.

Ironically, the Nazi regime – the backers of General Franco – criticised modern art as ‘degenerative’.
