A pair of featherweights who are looking to regain lost momentum will meet up in the Big Easy.

Francisco Rivera and Alex Caceras will square off at the UFC Fight Night card on June 6 in New Orleans. FOXSports.com initially reported the bout Tuesday.

For Rivera (10-4, 1 NC), the matchup is an opportunity to put his controversial loss to Urijah Faber behind him. The 33-year old Los Angeles-area native was winning his fight against Faber at UFC 181 before the tide turned on an uncalled eyepoke. Faber went on to win via TKO, and Rivera's appeal to the Nevada Athletic Commission was denied.

The Faber bout was Rivera's second straight loss, which came after a five-fight win streak.

Caceras (10-7, 1 NC), likewise, looks to shake off a two-fight losing streak. The MMA Lab fighter formerly known as "Bruce Leeroy" dropped bouts to Faber and Masanoria Kanehara, which came after a spell in which he won four of five.
