Matthew Thomas was one of the top high school recruits in the country in 2013. Out of Miami (Fla.) Booker T. Washington High School, Thomas held scholarship offers from every major school in the country. The 6'4, 210-pound Thomas was rated as a five-star recruit by all major services.

And now he wants out of his letter of intent he signed to attend Florida State, as he told the Miami Herald:

"I've told them it's nothing personal. I just didn't make the decision I really wanted to on Signing Day," said Thomas, who picked the Seminoles over USC, Georgia and Miami. "What happened was on Signing Day [was] I wasn't sure who I wanted to sign with. I had issues with different schools. But when I told my mom I didn't want to sign with anybody and wait and give it a few days she said I couldn't do that. She said, ‘FSU is a good school - pick them. It's close to home.' I wasn't agreeing with it. But I felt like I was being disrespectful to her if I didn't sign. So I made her happy."

Now, Thomas feels differently.

For its part, Florida State's staff does not plan to release Thomas, according to the report.
