Natasha Young and her husband, Sam Delbrouque, had been thinking about opening a craft beer bar when she walked by the empty space at 329 Main St. in downtown Pineville.

“I told Sam, ‘You have to meet me here right now,’” said Natasha Young.

Exposed brick lined the interior walls of the 100-year-old building, and its 2,000 sq. ft. would give them plenty of room to house a bar and bottle shop. They soon signed a lease and now plan to open Pintville Craft Beer in the space in mid-July or August. While there are breweries and beer bars aplenty in Charlotte, Natasha feels Pineville is long overdue for its own local spot.

“There are so many craft beer places in the city,” she said. “But where we live, you have to drive 20 minutes to go get a craft beer.”

Sam Delbrouque is a homebrewer who was exposed to great beer while living in northern France, just 20 minutes outside of Belgium. Since moving to the states, he and Natasha have owned and operated two restaurants.

While they will allow food to be brought in from the bakery next door as well as several new restaurants springing up around them, the two will focus exclusively on beer. They plan to have 24-30 taps, with one dedicated to nitro pours.

In addition to the taps, Pintville will also have a selection of bottles for sale.
