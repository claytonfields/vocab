Kasich awaits signal from God on presidential bid

Ohio Gov. John Kasich continued to signal his increasing interest in running for president Sunday, saying he’s waiting for a signal from God before making the call.

“My family is a consideration,” the Republican governor said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “Number two, the most important thing is, what does the Lord want me to do with my life?”

While he awaits that clarity, Kasich said he’s been active on the trail just in case. “I’m not going to figure [it] out laying in bed, hoping lightning strikes,” he said.

The governor made waves in New Hampshire over the weekend when he told activists to hold off on committing to any candidates until he made up his mind. He’s one of five Republican governors seriously considering a bid for the GOP presidential nomination, including Wisconsin’s Scott Walker, New Jersey’s Chris Christie, Michigan’s Rick Snyder and Louisiana’s Bobby Jindal.

Kasich has been barnstorming the country to promote a federal Constitutional amendment to balance the budget, and he recently stepped up his activity in the early GOP nominating states.
