I was out taking pictures for an upcoming post called “Scenes of Winter Light” (working title) when my friend Douglas “Three Stripes” Sargent (a hat tip to you, my friend) texted me to let me know that Andrew Ladd, captain of the Winnipeg Jets and two time Stanley Cup Winner, as well as Mike Richards, a Stanley Cup winner and former captain of the Philadelphia Flyers were going to be playing hockey at the Forks, which is about a 10 minute walk from my house. I immediately went home to change lenses and headed out.

What I found on top of the parking garage was a few hundred people with very big smiles on their face. It isn’t every day that big name NHL players take to twitter announcing their intentions to play a game of hockey with fans, which is exactly what happened. After a brief media scrum in which Richards and Ladd answered obligatory questions regarding the current lockout, teams were selected and the ball was dropped.
