Disease not climate change killing frogs

Updated

New research has revealed that disease is to blame for a decline in frog populations, not climate change as was first thought.

Scientists are racing against time to curb the fungal disease which is killing the world's frogs.

A University of Tasmania Professor and his colleagues in the United States are baffled by the highly contagious Chytrid Fungus.

More than 50 frog species in the Americas and at least four in Australia have been wiped out.

Initially global warming was thought to help the fungus spread but this has been ruled out.

Professor Hamish McCallum admits scientists have an uphill battle.

"At the moment we really have no clear way of combatting the disease," Prof McCallum said.

He says the spread of the disease should serve as a warning to humans.

"Every change that we're making to the world, climate change, habitat destruction and moving things around, all of these things are causing emerging disease threats which affect wildlife."

"But we've got to remember that almost all the diseases which have increased in humans have come from wildlife, so diseases in wildlife affect us all."

Tasmanian threat

Tasmania's Department of Primary Industries is worried by reports the fungus has reached populations in the south-west World Heritage Area.

Department Zoologist Michael Driessen says two species are already threatened.

"The green and gold frog and the striped marsh frog and we're currently looking into those two species as to whether or not chyrtid is a threat."

Scientists plan to use genetic techniques in the next stage of their research.
