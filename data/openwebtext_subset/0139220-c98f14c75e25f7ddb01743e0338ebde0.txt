As we posted on Monday, Junichi Masuda is going to make a big announcement on Pokemon Smash today pertaining to a Black and White sequel. Masuda reaffirmed a big announcement yesterday on his Twitter, stating, “Pokemon Smash on Sunday the 26th! Masuda will make an appearance. There will be a very important announcement, so do not miss it! Everyone please Tweet and blog this! Hope you watch it!”

Pokemon Smash airs in Japan on Sundays from 7:30 am to 8:30 am, which is Saturday afternoon from 2:30 to 3:30 pm in California (California’s time is at the top left of this page, so compare it to your own time to see when to expect the announcement). It probably won’t be announced right away, but within the hour of the show’s run. We’ll of course have full coverage of the announcement the second it airs, so stay tuned!
