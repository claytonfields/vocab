Ariana Grande has been slapped with a lawsuit over her 2015 song “One Last Time.”

Grande is being sued by Alex Greggs who claims that “One Last Time” copied a 2012 single he wrote for Skye Stevens titled “Takes All Night.” David Guetta, who wrote “One Last Time,” Rami Yacoub, Carl Falk, Universal Music Group and Republic Records are also listed as defendants in the lawsuit.

Greggs is claiming that “the similarity between ‘Takes All Night’ and ‘One Last Time’ is so striking that it is highly likely the works were not created independently of one another,” with the chorus or hook being the main reason for his lawsuit as the “harmonic background remains the same in both songs for the entire sixteen measures of the chorus.” Greggs is seeking $150,000 as settlement per each infringement.

In court documents, the lawsuits argues that: “Although the rhythm of the two compositions may differ to accommodate the prosody of the lyrics, there is substantial similarity on the most important rhythmic placement of the pitches on strong melodic and harmonic beats (1 and 3), which are what the listener perceives as most definitive of melody and, to a lesser extent, the harmonic accompaniment to a given melody.”

Grande is no stranger to legal troubles over her music. In 2013 she was sued for “The Way,” in which Minder Music claimed that a phrase of her song was a copy of the 1972 track “Troglodyte.” Grande’s lawsuit comes only a few days after Demi Lovato was sued by Sleigh Bells for her track “Stars.”
