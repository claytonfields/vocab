Alabama – Mark Meadows, the owner of a local Chick-fil-A is getting a lot of attention because of an act of kindness he didn’t even know anyone had seen.

“We have people walk in on occasion that need some help. I could tell he needed some help,” said Meadows.

Meadows gave a homeless man who came into his store a free meal, but he didn’t stop there.

“I noticed he was wringing his hands and noticed he didn’t have gloves. I said ‘you don’t have any gloves, he said ‘no’. I said you need some gloves. On the table next to me I had the gloves that I had gave to him. He was very hesitant I said ‘no, you need gloves, I can get some more, it’s not a big deal.” More
