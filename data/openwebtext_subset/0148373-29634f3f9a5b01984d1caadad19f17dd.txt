It’s been almost 20 years since Bob Odenkirk and David Cross’ cult comedy sketch masterpiece, Mr. Show, made its debut on HBO. The show left its mark and the cast and crew (featuring the likes of Paul F. Tompkins, Scott Aukerman, and Brian Posehn, among others) parted ways after four hilarious seasons. Following many months of hints and teases, Netflix finally confirmed that it was bringing the gang back together in the form of With Bob And David, a new half-hour sketch show set to make its way to the streaming service later this year.

If you can’t conceive how you could possibly wait any longer to see what Bob Odenkirk and David Cross have in store, well, you might not have to. The A.V. Club has an amazing opportunity for Mr. Show fans to win a pair of tickets to one of four live tapings of With Bob And David, coming up very soon in the Los Angeles/Glendale area. On Saturday, April 25 and Thursday, April 30, the show will be taping at two separate times (7:30 p.m. and 9 p.m.) and we’ll select four lucky readers (one for each taping) to win two tickets to the show. For your chance to win, simply send an email to avcontests@theonion.com with the subject line “With Bob And David Saturday” or “With Bob And David Thursday,” depending on which day you’d like to attend. In the body of the email, please include your name, mailing address, and which taping time you’d prefer.

Please note that this giveaway is for tickets to the show only and does not include transportation of any kind. Entrants must be 18 or older to win. We’ll select four winners from the eligible entries tomorrow at 1 p.m. CST, who will then be notified via email and given further instructions. With Bob And David will air later this year, exclusively on Netflix, and is being produced by Netflix and Abso Lutely Productions.
