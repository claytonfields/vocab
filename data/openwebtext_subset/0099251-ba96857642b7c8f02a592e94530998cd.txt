A woman described in court as an animal lover has admitted cutting a rabbit’s ears off.

Tereska Al-Rawi, of Dirkhill Road, claimed she amputated the ears by accident.

Bradford and Keighley Magistrates’ Court yesterday heard that Al-Rawi, 55, initially lied to the RSPCA and claimed she had found the rabbit in a park and that it was already injured.

The RSPCA released pictures of the injured animal in an appeal to help track down those responsible for its injuries, which also included a broken leg that Al-Rawi claimed was nothing to do with her.

Nigel Monaghan, prosecuting for the RSPCA, said the white Angora rabbit – which are known for their long and soft wool – was taken to a vet on October 12 last year after Al-Rawi claimed to have found it.

He said despite treatment the animal had to be put down.

Mr Monaghan said Al-Rawi eventually confessed to buying the rabbit on October 11 last year from a second-hand shop, before cutting off what she believed was matted fur.

“She was adamant in interview that she did not know she had cut the ears off,” said Mr Monaghan.

The court heard, in mitigation, that Al-Rawi bought the rabbit after taking pity on it. The animal was already not in a good condition at the time, the court was told.

Her solicitor said: “She took the rabbit in with her heart in the right place. She is an animal lover with three dogs and two cats.

“She was reckless and should have been a bit more careful in what she was doing.”

Magistrates adjourned the case for probation reports to be prepared, and chairman Nadine Tidswell said: “She has no previous convictions, but it is a very serious offence and very upsetting for everyone, including the lady.”

Al-Rawi, who admitted a charge of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal, was released on bail to be sentenced on April 28.
