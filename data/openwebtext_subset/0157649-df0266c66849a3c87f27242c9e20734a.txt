One person is dead after four workers were shocked while setting up a tent outside a home near Watford Thursday evening.

Lambton OPP said six male workers with a tent company were setting up for a family wedding at 8990 LaSalle Line, when a tent pole touched a power line and shocked four of them just after 5 p.m.

Two were airlifted to hospital, the other two taken by ambulance. Two workers weren’t injured.

Jeremy Bowley of London died from his injuries, while the other three, including a West Elgin resident, remain in hospital with serious injuries, police said.

Alvinston firefighters arrived on scene with paramedics and performed CPR on two of the men, said Fire Chief Ron McCabe.

The Ministry of Labour and Hydro One were both called to the scene.

Outside of the home Thursday night, a white tent could be seen partially collapsed and surrounded by police tape. A minivan filled with tent supplies was parked in the driveway.

Police blocked off a portion of LaSalle Line, between Hardy Creek and Sexton roads, for about an hour. They later reopened it except for the section between Salem and Sexton roads.

McCabe said accident scenes like this are traumatizing for firefighters. He held a debriefing session once his crew returned to the fire hall.

“I’m sure for these guys it will be a long time before they forget what they saw today,” he said. “These sort of calls are never easy because we live in the area.

“These same guys will drive by that location numerous times and that will always come back to mind.”
