Juventus have confirmed Mauricio Isla is poised to join Queens Park Rangers and is set to undergo a medical on Sunday.

As revealed by Sky Sports on Friday, QPR have lined up a loan deal for Chile international right-back Isla as Harry Redknapp looks to add to his squad.

Isla impressed for Chile at the World Cup, but the 26-year-old is well down the pecking order at Juventus and struggled to hold down a regular place in the side last season.

Juventus are happy to send Isla out on loan with a view to a permenant deal with the club's general director, Giuseppe Marotta, confirming a deal had been agreed with QPR.

"Tomorrow Isla will have his medical in England, as a deal has been reached with QPR," said Marotta.

"We have already reached an agreement with the English club and the player has given his availability, it will be a loan with right of a permanent deal."

Marotta confirmed Juventus are in the market for a new defender as well as a striker and he refused to rule out a move for Manchester City's Serbia international Matija Nastasic, 21, to fill the centre-back role.

"Now we are looking for a striker and a centre-back," added Marotta.

"Nastasic? We'll see if it will be him or someone else."
