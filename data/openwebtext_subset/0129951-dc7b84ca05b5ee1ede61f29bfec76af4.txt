This latest addition to the Pure Blue Japan lineup reflects a modern silhouette with the slim cut and tapered leg opening coupled with the beautiful and rich Deep Indigo color that is only attainable by using both indigo dyed warp and weft threads.

The slubby nature of the denim allows for a beautiful fading contrast with wear over time, but given the Indigo x Indigo fabric combination of this denim, the will take longer than your usual pair to fade.
