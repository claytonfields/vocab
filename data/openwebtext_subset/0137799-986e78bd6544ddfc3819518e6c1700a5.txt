CHICAGO -- Athletics third baseman Brandon Inge will travel back to Oakland to have an MRI on his dislocated right shoulder.

A's manager Bob Melvin announced the plan for Inge after Sunday's 7-3 loss to the Chicago White Sox.

Inge was hurt Saturday on a diving stop in the seventh inning. He remained in the game and started a double play two batters later. Inge then drove in the go-ahead run in the eighth, leading the team to believe the injury wasn't too severe.

Inge was held out of the lineup Sunday. The team decided he should meet with doctors to determine the extent of the injury and whether he can play through it without causing long-term issues.

The 35-year-old Inge is hitting .216 with 12 homers and 52 RBIs.
