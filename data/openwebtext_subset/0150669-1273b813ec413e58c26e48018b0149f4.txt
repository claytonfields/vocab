Attempted Robbery on 114th Street

We’ve just received a notice from Dean Terry Martinez concerning an attempted robbery on November 12, 2011 at about 7:30 pm in a brownstone lobby on W 114th Street between Broadway and Amsterdam. Note that the security alert came from NYPD, and so was not necessarily a Columbia building.

The suspect, pictured after the jump, followed the victim into the hallway, displayed a gun, and demanded his iPhone. He demonstrated the same behavior when approaching the second victim. While the wording of these cases is somewhat unclear, it appears that upon receiving the surrendered phones of the two victims, the suspect returned the phones to them when he realized that they were not actual iPhones.

The suspect, described by the NYPD as “Male/Black/30 yrs/5’8”/160 lbs/ black hat/green waist length jacket/ blue jeans,” then fled the building and ran away down Amsterdam Avenue.
