Seriously, I now have a purple glitter Halloween tree!!! But let me start at the beginning, I mentioned in my bio how Halloween was scaring my kiddos this year so we were doing all things cute, and green and purple and glitter and staying away from monsters and such.

My Santa, being the awesome Santa that they are, messaged me throughout the process and then when I mentioned I updated my address I scared the crap out of them because they had already shipped! (you super efficient Santa you!) however since I knew I would be moving, I had used my lovely nanas address to make sure nothing got lost along its way.

Fast forward to today, and my poor Santa is FINALLY getting their thank you, because my nana just came to visit and brought me said Halloween gift. Which by the way is absolutely PERFECT!! I have actually always wanted a Halloween tree, and this little guy is like the insert really expensive car here of Halloween trees. Totally covered in purple glitter (I think my three year old shattered my ear drums screaming PURPLE IS MY FAVORITE! when she saw it) AND it has colored lights and pumpkin and bat ornaments, which my two year old insisted on putting on all by himself... so that took two hours (for four ornaments!)

Amazing Amazing Amazing, I smile looking at it and my kiddos love it... plus it makes this really neat design on the ceiling! So, very sorry Santa that the thank you took longer to arrive then the gift. Dont doubt that we love it, you rocked this wicked treat that will be our holiday centerpiece until the impending Apocalypse arrives... even then I will probably take it with us from some macabre tent house decoration!
