Just a quick ask to apologize for busting you out with your next idea x'D That was definitely not intended. And I'm sure we, personal fandom of yours, will all be waiting patiently so take your sweet time! Fighting!

Ah it’s you again dear anon ^^

Thank you so much! And don’t worry about exposing my secret plans, it would have come out anyway. There is also a heart series I want to make, and a flower series and a music making series and a date series and a lazy day series and a sports series and a puppy series and a gazillion other series as well.

The new album is soooooooo inspiring my head explodes with ideas! BTS has such an amazing energy to inspire all ARMYs hearts and minds. I love them so much!

What is your favorite song from Tear album?

I can’t decide but Anpanman, Untold Truth, and tear:outro are my top 3.

Need to catch some sleep now. I wish you a good day and let’s antizipate their BBMA performance together 😍😪
