A new poll shows only 1 in 4 Americans believe Sarah Palin is qualified to be president.

(CNN) - Two days after Sarah Palin fired up a large crowd at Glenn Beck's Restoring Honor rally in Washington, a newly released survey suggests a clear majority of Americans don't think the former vice presidential nominee has the right credentials to be president.

According to the new survey from Vanity Fair and CBS News' 60 Minutes, only 1 in 4 of all adults thinks Palin is qualified to be commander-in-chief while 60 percent say she is not.

By a narrow 47-40 percent margin however, Republicans do feel Palin has the right stuff to be president. But self identified conservatives – constituting the segment of the GOP largely thought to most favor the former Alaska governor – are essentially split 41-40 percent on her abilities to govern the country.

What may also be troubling for the former Alaska governor if she finds herself in a general election matchup, 3 in 5 independent voters don't think Palin is qualified while only 21 percent do. Among moderates, the numbers are even worse with 70 percent reporting they lack confidence in Palin.

Predictably, the numbers are most dire for the former vice presidential nominee among self-identified Democrats: 3 in 4 say Palin isn't up to the responsibilities of the Oval Office.

The survey, conducted by CBS News between August 3-5, surveyed 847 U.S. adults by telephone.
