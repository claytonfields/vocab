TOUCHING BREASTS

Touching breast separation (also known as "kissing breasts") is where your two breasts are touching or almost touching when you are standing sans a bra. If your breasts are such, you have probably figured out that a braâ€™s center panel (also called the center gore and center bridge) will have fit issues and probably not rest against your sternum.

The underwires of a traditional underwire bra will probably tilt outward and away from your body at your sternum because again, there is no space available for them to rest against your sternum.

There is also a rare condition called "Symmastia" where the breast tissue between the two breasts is connected (see the Additional Considerations section). This breast separation is not common, but presents bra fit issues as well.
