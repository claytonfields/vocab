He added: "I’m actually proud of the work my coaching staff and I have achieved over our time at the helm of England.

"The transition from the squad whose average age was 30 to now being the youngest in the tournament is both remarkable and exciting for the future of English football.

"I would have loved to stay on for another two years. However, I am pragmatic and I know we are in the results business.

"My contract was always up after the Euros, so now is the time for someone else to oversee the progress of this young, hungry and extremely talented group of players.

"Ray and Gary arrived with me as part of my coaching team and will leave with me. I’d like to thank them for their dedicated support and for the major part they’ve played in our team preparation."
