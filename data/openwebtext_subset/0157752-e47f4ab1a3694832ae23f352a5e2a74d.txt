BEIRUT – Bashar al-Assad has shuffled his government following weeks of reports he would replace the country’s prime minister amid the growing criticism of the current cabinet’s economic policies.

Syria’s state news reported Wednesday afternoon that the president tasked Electricity Minister Imad Khamis with forming a new government, ending Wael al-Halqi’s nearly four-year tenure as prime minister.

The formation of a new cabinet comes after the parliament—which was elected on April 13—met for its first session on June 6, electing Baath Party stalwart Hadiyeh al-Abbas as the first ever Syrian parliamentary speaker.

Article 125 of Syria’s new constitution—which was ratified in 2012—stipulates that the country’s cabinet will be considered “resigned” upon the convening of a new parliament, and will only hold a “caretaker role.” However, the constitution makes no mention if current ministers need to be shuffled from their positions.

Reports had abounded in recent weeks though that Assad would select a new prime minister as economic conditions continue to worsen in regime-controlled areas of the war-torn country, sparking unusually harsh criticisms from regime supporters.

Pro-regime outlets speculated that prominent Aleppo businessman Fares Shehabi—who was elected to the new parliament—was a candidate for the premiership. Shehabi is known for his outspoken criticism of regime economic policies.

However, Assad tapped the Damascus-native Khamis—electricity minister since April 2011—as the head of the new cabinet, despite the crisis-ridden state of Syria’s electrical grid, which is beset by rolling power cuts.

The new premier’s international standing is also low, having been sanctioned by the EU in March 2012 for “using power cuts as a method of repression.”
