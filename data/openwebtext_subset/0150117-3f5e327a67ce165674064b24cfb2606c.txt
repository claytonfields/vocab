It's been an eventful Monday for the Buffalo Bills. First, general manager Buddy Nix steps down, although the move had been in the works for months. Second, the Bills also opened organized team activities.

The most interesting note for Buffalo’s OTAs came from the quarterback position. The Bills’ team website reports veteran journeyman Tarvaris Jackson took first-team reps on Monday, while Kevin Kolb and rookie EJ Manuel were second and third string, respectively.

Although it's very early to read much into this in May, it’s still interesting to point out that Bills rookie head coach Marrone gave Jackson the first nod. Someone has to get starter reps, and perhaps the coaching staff feels Jackson is ahead of the competition at this stage.

Marrone insisted that he will eventually switch up the rotation in practice during this three-way competition. All three quarterbacks will get a fair shot. However, Jackson is probably the least-favored quarterback of the three to win the job. Kolb played decent football with the Arizona Cardinals last year before getting injured, and Manuel is definitely considered the team’s future -- if not the present.

Jackson, who rotted on Buffalo’s bench in 2012, is pretty much stuck in the middle between the two quarterbacks. We did a recent poll in the AFC East blog to on who Bills fans thought would win the job, and Jackson received just five percent of the vote. But it appears in the second week of May, at least, that Jackson still has the chance to pull off a three-way upset in Buffalo.
