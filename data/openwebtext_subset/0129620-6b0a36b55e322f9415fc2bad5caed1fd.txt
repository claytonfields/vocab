I was so excited to see my Santa was from Austin, Texas. I visited there a couple of years ago and loved the place. So even before I opened it I knew I was going to love it.

My Santa was so generous, I was actually a little horrified to see the cost of postage, ouch! A few of the sweets we do already have in the UK (what can I say, we're a little Americanified) but I was made up to get the girl scout cookies in particular. I've already tried a few things, including the bacon jerky and honey pecans which I loved. Thanks so much to my Santa and I expect I'll be a couple of pounds heavier by the time I get through all these treats.
