As one of the lucky few to have the chance to buy the New Nintendo 3DS Ambassador Edition, it safely arrived today courtesy of Yodel’s logistic prowess.



I thought that, for posterity if not anything else, that it would be good to share a photo gallery of the bundle’s contents, which has been made available in limited quantities ahead of the New Nintendo 3DS officially launching in Europe.



Inside the rather plain outer box, those that have handed over £179.99 will find the New Nintendo 3DS Ambassador Edition, two exclusive Cover Plate sets, and a new Charging Cradle.



The photos below take you through everything, briefly comparing to my The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds 3DS XL and highlighting some location changes around the system such as the power, charging and Wi-Fi indicators now being grouped.
