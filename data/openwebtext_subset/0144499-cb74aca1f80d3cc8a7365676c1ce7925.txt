Earn bitcoin from mining

Bitcoin mining is the process by which new Bitcoins are generated. Mining validates bitcoin transactions on the network in return for allowing you to participate in a race to solve an algorithm. The winner of this race submits their validated bitcoin transactions to the network, and if they are legitimate transactions, the network rewards the winner with Bitcoins. The reward is dispensed about every 10 minutes and currently pays out 12.5 BTC. Every 4 years, the amount of BTC per reward is reduced by half. Luckily, with the right bitcoin mining software, all the hard parts are done for you.

So the first thing you are going to want to do is to either get mining equipment or join a cloud mining service.

When looking into buying mining equipment, the three main attributes to think about are the hashrate (_how fast a machine work_s), efficiency (amount of electricity required per hash), and price. Efficiency is incredibly important, as the cost of electricity is your only marginal cost. The more efficient your machine, the higher margins you will have.

Below are the three main manufacturers of mining equipment

Bitmain

Bitfury

Spondoolies Tech

You can check out reviews of their machines here: https://99bitcoins.com/best-bitcoin-miners-2016-hardware-reviews/

If you decide to buy your own mining equipment, then you will need to download mining software. You can find a review of the top 6 bitcoin mining softwares here: https://99bitcoins.com/the-6-best-bitcoin-mining-software/

Cloud mining is another path that you can go down. This option is easier since you do not have to deal with setting up mining equipment, replacing old mining equipment when they are no longer profitable, dealing with the heat issues and electricity costs, and updating bitcoin mining software. However, the downside with cloud mining is that it lowers your profits and there is an incredibly high risk of fraud. If you decide to go with a cloud mining operation, make sure to do a lot of due diligence into the legitimacy of the company.

Below is a list of popular cloud hashing services. Please note that being listed in this section is NOT an endorsement of these services. There have been a tremendous amount of Bitcoin cloud mining scams.

Hashing24

Hashflare

Minergate

Hashnest

NiceHash

Eobot

Once you have decided to go with mining equipment or cloud mining, you should decide whether you want to join a mining pool or if you want to create a mining facility. Mining pools are good for hobbyists as they allow you to combine your hashing power with other miners who then all share the rewards. Otherwise, your individual miner will be competing with the entire network to win the full 12.5 BTC every 10 minutes. On December 23rd, the hashrate you would be competing with is about 2.5 million tera hashes per second (trillions of hashes per second). The only way to compete on your own is to build a mining facility, which in itself, is a business.

Below are some of the most popular mining pools:

AntPool

F2Pool

BW.com

BTCCPool

SlushPool

BTC.com

HaoBTC

BGMiners

ViaBTC

1Hash

P2P Pool - Decentralized mining pool
