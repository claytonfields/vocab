I'm trying to get up and running on the raspberry pi 2 with the recently released ghc binaries for armv7, available here:

https://www.haskell.org/ghc/download_ghc_7_10_2#linux_armv7

This says it was built with debian jesse, so I've installed debian jesse on my pi2. I've installed ghc successfully - at least ghci works. But there's no cabal, and apparently ghc 7.10.2 requires cabal 1.22+. The debian version of cabal is something like 1.16 (and also would install ghc 7.6.x). So I'm trying to install cabal-install from source with its bootstrap.sh script. That downloads the mtl package and builds a 'Setup' executble, then tries to execute it. But the Setup exe fails with 'illegal instruction'.

According to the download page, the 'gold' linker is required. I added that by doing

ln -s which gold ~/bin/ld

and setting my path to include ~/bin. Same result unfortunately.

Next up I tried reinstalling the ghc binaries with gold (I think). So as root:

> ln -s `which gold` /usr/local/bin/ld > cd ghc-7.10.2 > make install

Once again ghc was successfully installed, but the result for building cabal-install is the same:

Any ideas?

I'm wondering if the symlinks is the correct way to enable gold for this? Maybe I need to add that as a ghc option in each cabal project, or there's some other way to use gold? Or maybe that's not the issue at all?
