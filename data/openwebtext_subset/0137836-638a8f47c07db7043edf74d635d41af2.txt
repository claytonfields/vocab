DENVER -- A group of Colorado police chiefs are asking the state for more money to help keep marijuana-related crime under control, according to a letter sent to the governor this week.

In the letter, the Colorado Association of Chiefs of Police told Gov. John Hickenlooper they were disappointed to learn that local law enforcement would receive little direct funding under a newly released plan for how to spend pot tax revenue.

"Many of our local law enforcement agencies have diverted staff from other operations into marijuana enforcement, leaving gaps in other service areas as a direct result of marijuana legalization," the letter says.

The letter asks Hickenlooper to create a grant program to help defray department costs related to marijuana legalization.

Medical and recreational marijuana revenues are expected to be in the neighborhood of $133 million in the next fiscal year. Hickenlooper's latest budget proposes spending the bulk of the money on youth marijuana use prevention and addiction treatment, reserving just $3 million for enforcement agencies.

The CACP letter says more money could be used to train officers to better identify stoned drivers, set up more DUI checkpoints and launch a statewide marijuana crimes database.
