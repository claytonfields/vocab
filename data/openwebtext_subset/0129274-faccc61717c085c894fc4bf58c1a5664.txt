The 2 year pilot process I led at Fair Trade USA has ended and we are beginning to share some learnings from my teamâ€™s work with coffee workers in estates and independent smallholder coffee farmers. This infographic shows some general info collected from farm workers who worked at coffee estates participating in our pilot process in Brazil, Colombia and Nicaragua. There were around 2,700 coffee workers in 5 estates part of our pilots (we also worked with a coffee estate in Ethiopia but the info is not included here). For some of the questions in our surveys, we got more than 900 responses from random samples of coffee workers. I hope this info helps to continue bringing awareness to some of the issues coffee workers face and helps us to increase (even if just a little) our farm worker IQ in coffee.
