MIT’s Festival for Art Science and Technology will culminate this weekend May 7th and 8th with FAST Light, a series of innovative site specific installations around the MIT campus and along the Charles River. Installations by MIT Department of Architecture Head, Nader Tehrani (founder and principal of Office dA and of the newly formed NADAAA), Professor Sheila Kennedy (Principal of Kennedy & Violich Architecture), and Professor Meejin Yoon (Principal of Höweler + Yoon Architecture and MY Studio) are among the final river front projects that will light up the night along the river this Saturday and Sunday in front of Killian Court at MIT.

Liquid Archive by Tehrani and Urbonas will create an iconic floating inflatable urban screen in the Charles for the projections at the scale of the city. SOFT Rockers by Kennedy will provide clean energy solar charging stations in the form of outdoor public rocking chairs that absorb power during the day, and illuminate at night.

LightDrift by Yoon will animate the waterfront through an interactive public installation of 90 floating orbs that respond to pedestrian activity and use on the river’s edge. These installations along with Light Bridge and SKY Event will transform Memorial Drive for two nights while Memorial Drive is closed to traffic and open to the public for FAST Light.

Other installations on view through the campus include: Skylar Tibbits’ voltaDom, a packed vaulted ceiling between buildings 56 and 66; Joel Lamere’s Overliner, a spiraling origami installation in building E25; Nick Gelpi’s Unflat Pavilion, a bent plywood pavilion; and Meejin Yoon’s Windscreen, an array of small scale wind turbines that transforms wind energy directly into a field of light, are among 20+ installations by faculty and students in the Department of Architecture, the Media Lab and across the Institute at MIT open to the public.
