Police used a full court press Saturday night to catch a coyote who found herself trapped in a basketball court in Riverside Park.

The wily canine had been spotted at around 9:30 p.m. by a woman who notified police.

Officers on foot and in cars gave chase as she beat a crooked path.

“It’s been running back and forth from 72nd and 79th streets and Riverside Drive,’’ said one officer. “We’re just trying not to hurt the little guy.’’

The officers finally penned the skinny black and white animal in the court at 76th Street — but she kept trying to jump the fence.

The animal was caught 90 minutes later after she was hit by two tranquilizer darts. She’ll eventually be released into the wild, police said.

Cops weren’t surprised when they discovered their quarry’s sex.

“We knew it had to be a girl,’’ said another cop. “Because she was so feisty.’’
