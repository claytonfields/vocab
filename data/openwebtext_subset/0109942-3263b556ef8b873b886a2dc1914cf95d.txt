On a typical day, two protesters stand outside Choices Women's Medical Center in Jamaica, New York. The man hands out antiabortion flyers; a nun passes out rosary beads. For the most part, things are calm. Since Nov. 8, that is no longer the case.

Since the election, aggressive protesters have been flocking to the clinic, which provides abortions as well as gynecology, prenatal services and STD testing. On Saturdays dozens of protesters spread out half a block in either direction of the doorway, holding signs, screaming at women entering the clinic and impeding on the 15-foot buffer they are legally required to adhere to beyond the clinic doors.

"Their behavior has become incredibly more aggressive to the point we've had to call the police the last three to four weeks," said Camille Barbone, vice president of operations at the clinic. "There's much more condemnation than I've ever seen before. They're pushing cellphone cameras into patients' faces."
