The man who was convicted of murdering a Pizza X driver last month was sentenced to 73 consecutive years in prison today.

Monroe County Judge Marc Kellams said James Finney was likely to re-offend.

“I think you’re dangerous, James,” Kellams said. “The only way I can protect society is to lock you up.”

A jury convicted Finney of one count of murder and two counts of possessing a handgun without a license. The judge gave Finney the maximum sentence for each count.

Finney shot Adam Sarnecki in a Bloomington Pizza X parking lot nearly two years ago after Sarnecki found Finney trying to break into a car.

Members of Sarnecki’s family testified before the judge read the sentence, encouraging him to give Finney the maximum prison time.

“I hope you spend every day in prison thinking about the life you took that wasn’t yours to take,” Adam’s sister Chelsea Sarnecki said.

Several other family members spoke directly to Finney, encouraging him to seek God’s forgiveness.

Kellams said Finney’s prior criminal record showed escalation in crimes and was not surprised it ended in murder.

“Everyone wants to see some remorse, and I’m not sure there is any,” Kellams said.

Depending on Finney’s behavior and whether he completes counseling or education programs while incarcerated, he could be released in 32 years and 6 months at the earliest.
