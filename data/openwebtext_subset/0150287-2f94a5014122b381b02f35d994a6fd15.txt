They’re picking Colorado’s 1st and 6th Congressional District delegates today. The results for CO-1 are now in: Ted Cruz has gotten all three delegates. CO-6 will be chosen later. Note that these are apparently officially bound delegates. Also note that the remaining CDs will be coming in over the next week.

I will update with CO-6 results as they come in. For those wondering: CO-1 is Denver and CO-6 is Denver’s eastern suburbs, more or less. Strong Democratic and swing Republican, respectively. Seeing the CO-6 results will be interesting.

UPDATE: Ted Cruz has also swept CO-6. Next up is CO-7 on Thursday, with the remaining CDs on Friday and the statewide delegates on Saturday. Presumably the other two campaigns will have started taking these results seriously before then?
