Introduction to /timeout

Installation

/timeoutâ€”When you really wish you could /kick from general

Overview

/timeout lets your team's admins moderate any channel. This Slack add-on will immediately and automatically delete any messages sent from the member in timeout within that channel. Additionally, it will tease the team member for attempting to say something while in timeout. /timeout is a fun and light-hearted, albeit slightly rude, tool for your team.

By default, /timeout will also troll the member in timeout in the #channel they have been temporarily silenced in. This feature is optional, and can be turned off in team settings (accessable once logged in on this site). The frequency at which the user is insulted can also be modified in your team settings. If you dont want everyone in the #channel to have to listen to the insults, you can opt to have the member in timeout be sent the insults as a PM from the Timeout Bot.

Also, you can customize and vote on the insults and taunts that /timeout will send; I hope you all make use of this feature as much as my teams do! When you first sign up, a standard list of insults and taunts will be added for you, but you can edit or delete any of these. Your team members can also upvote and downvote any of these. The higher an insult or taunt's vote-rating, the more likely it is to be used. If an insult or taunt hits -5, it will be deleted automatically.

Please note that if you would like insults and taunts to work in private groups, you will need to add the Timeout Bot to that group, or our sassy little robot cannot say anything!

Finally, if there are any other features you'd like to see added to /timeout please don't hesitate to shoot me an email at: support[at]slacktimeout.com.
