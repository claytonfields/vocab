Feyenoord caused €5.2m damages

Feyenoord fans caused damage worth €5.2m to the city of Rome, claims the Minister for the Interior.

The Dutch hooligans ran riot ahead of their Europa League match against Roma last month.

They damaged historic monuments, including the recently renovated Fontana della Barcaccia, smashed local transport vehicles and urinated on ancient Roman walls.

“The police acted with professionalism and balance, as in these situations it’s best to limit the damage,” said Minister for the Interior Angelino Alfano.

“The devastating fury of the fans was also fuelled by their drunken state, despite the ban on sale of alcohol in the city that day.

“We have finalised our evaluation of the damages in various different sectors caused by the Feyenoord fans to be circa €5.2m.”

The Dutch Government has refused to pay for any damages caused, while plans to play an Italy-Holland friendly with money going to the reconstruction were also dashed.

Roma eliminated Feyenoord with a 2-1 victory in Rotterdam, a game that had to be suspended for over 10 minutes because the Dutch supporters threw coins, lighters and a large inflatable banana on to the field.
