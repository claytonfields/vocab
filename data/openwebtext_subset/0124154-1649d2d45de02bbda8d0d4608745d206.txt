*sigh*

i don’t know how to meet people

i don’t know how to find people to talk to about things

lexi’s convinced that i will ~terrify~ anyone i talk to for long, which hasn’t exactly helped things along here

i mean, really, that’s only one facet of my lovely personality!

but in all seriousness, i have no outlets and i am sick of being cooped up like i’m some sort of danger to society when i have been nothing but cooperative and, dare i say, even nice? helpful? to people lately

i’m just a sweet little shapeshifter whose mind doesn’t entirely translate into human morality scales that can play nice when needed. i just need someone else to talk to because nobody listens to me in here.
