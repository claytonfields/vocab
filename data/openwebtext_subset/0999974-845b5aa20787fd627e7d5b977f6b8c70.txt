His whole-hearted approach made Jonjo Shelvey a popular figure during his time at Liverpool.

And his reputation among fans was further enhanced when he gave Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson a verbal volley in front of the Main Stand at Anfield in September 2012.

Shelvey was leaving the pitch after being sent off by referee Mark Halsey for a two-footed lunge on Jonny Evans and he believed Ferguson had contributed to his dismissal by his reaction to the incident. At the time he accused Ferguson of ‘grassing’ him up.

Now Shelvey has revealed further details about the clash which endeared him, not just to the Anfield faithful, but apparently to the United boss himself.

He now accepts he was wrong to confront Ferguson – but says the Scot was impressed with his passion.

Shelvey said: “I was a bit immature then and a bit silly. I pulled him aside afterwards and apologised to him and he was spot on with me.

“He said, ‘no I like it. It shows you’ve got a bit of balls about you’.

“I got a few high fives around town for the next few months, but it was silly from me on the professional stage. You don’t do something like that.

“I was young and I was starting for Liverpool against Manchester United, games don’t come much bigger.

“I was immature, the occasion got the better of me. It was part of growing up and you learn from those sort of things.”

There was no happy ending to the 39th minute dismissal despite Steven Gerrard giving the Reds the lead. Second half goals from Rafael and a Robin van Persie penalty won it for United.

Shelvey played 69 times in three years at Anfield, departing in the summer of 2013 to Swansea, where his form has earned him another England call-up.
