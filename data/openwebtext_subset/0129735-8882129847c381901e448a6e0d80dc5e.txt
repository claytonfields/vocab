WASHINGTON — The final day of the Senate’s 2013 session ended on an anticlimactic note on Friday as senators pressed the pause button on the bickering that had kept the chamber nearly paralyzed this year.

The day opened with a bit of a scare when Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, was hospitalized in the early morning after falling ill.

Mr. Reid, who just turned 74, remained in the hospital for most of the day and was at home by the evening.

Mr. Reid’s spokesman, Adam Jentleson, said the senator went to the hospital as a precaution.

“The doctors diagnosed him as exhausted, not anything more serious, and have cleared him to go back to work,” he said. “He spent today resting, talking to family, friends and colleagues, reading the news and discussing Senate business.”
