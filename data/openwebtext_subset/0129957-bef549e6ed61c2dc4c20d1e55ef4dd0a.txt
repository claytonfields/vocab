It began with a worried call to Hamilton police about a man entering a city housing apartment building armed with a handgun.

It ended as an object lesson in common sense.

During the two hours it took to resolve the incident at 430 Cumberland Ave. Friday afternoon, the Gage Park neighbourhood was flooded with squad cars, roads were blocked off, heavily armed and armoured police surrounded and sealed off an eight-storey building while tenants, locked inside their units, called friends and family trying to find out what was going on.

Michaela and Rodney Reid live across the hall from the 2nd floor unit that was the focus of the police attention and for the better part of an hour they were trapped in their apartment with their door ajar and a heavily armed Emergency Response Officer standing just inside their foyer, peering out.

"One of the grey guys, you know, with full body armour and the big weapons, came in and was listening to what was going on across the hall," Reid said outside the building after they were allowed to sneak out a side stairwell.

The family that lives in that unit tended to be noisier than most, Reid said, but hadn't previously caused any real trouble.

"We don't know what's going on," Michaela said.

Ahmed Qasin knew what was going on â€” and he raced over to the building where his parents and two younger brothers lived, confronting the first police officers he saw and trying to convince them that it was all a mistake.

A mere 25 metres away, an officer with a shotgun and a police dog and handler crouched behind a squad car, keeping an eye on the second-floor unit police had sealed off.

"My brother, he has a fake gun, you know, it's a gun for the birds," said Qasin in halting English. "For this, I think, they are arresting my brother!"
