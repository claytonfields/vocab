Lea Michele broke the news on Monday that she would be appearing on the seventh and final season of FX’s Sons of Amarchy by excitedly tweeting, “I’ll be appearing on an episode of my favorite show @SonsofAnarchy! Thank you so much @Harparbar & @sutterink #SOAFX” Earlier today Lea was photographed on the Sons of Anarchy set filming a scene with show matriarch Katey Sagal in which Lea was wearing a waitress uniform and both ladies were smoking cigarettes and chatting on a bench.

The scene jibes with details about Lea’s character Gertie released by the network, which describe her as a single mom working as a waitress at a truck stop. Gertie “connects with Gemma,” played by Katey Sagal, “during a difficult time.” I assume we are seeing Gertie and Gemma connecting during a difficult time in the photos. 🙂

To wrap things up, here are Lea’s still-excited tweets from the last few days while filming SOA:

Day two at @SonsofAnarchy today… pretty easy getting up at 6am when I'm this excited! pic.twitter.com/sSX4g2zVOi — Lea Michele (@msleamichele) July 29, 2014
