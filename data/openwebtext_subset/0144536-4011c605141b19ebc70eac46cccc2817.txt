With 186 stores in the US, Apple has a retail presence in 37 of the 50 states. 29 of those states have multiple stores, including New York with 13, Florida with 14, and California with 38. That's why it makes total sense that Apple would build an entire fake store on the Warner Brothers parking lot in Los Angeles over Memorial Day weekend in order to film a commercial. According to Valleywag, that is exactly what the computer company did.

According to the site's sources, the set took two days to build and was used to film a commercial that will air during the WWDC keynote. The store was full-size and sported all of the hardware and software that one would expect in a (real) Apple Store.

Rather then shutting down a low-traffic Apple Store somewhere in middle-America, Apple instead chose to presumably pay workers overtime and holiday time to have an almost completely private set in California. The set was apparently closed to all but a few select crew members; Valleywag assumes the move was made to prevent the amount of hoopla that surrounded the closing of the 5th Avenue store for a commercial shoot recently.

If all this is to be believed, and we have no reason to think it isn't, then Apple seems to be up to some super top-secret commercial filming here. Could it be just 3G iPhones or something bigger? Just one more week. You can do it.
