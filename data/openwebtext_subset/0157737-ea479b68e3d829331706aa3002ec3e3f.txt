hmmm- a couple (at least) inaccuracies in the list - and it would seem many are assumptions without any facts to back them up.Hugh Heffner was allegedly terrified of LSD- look for the story of the Grateful Dead playing on his show "Playboy After Dark" . There is a great story of (I think Phil And Billy) trying to dose him all night, and one allegedly suceeding, despite Hugh taking great pains to avoid such an event)Also- Ken Kesey never really sold "blotter paper art" (his son Zane now sells blotter art) . Ken did sign blotter art back in the mid/late 90's for Tom Lyttle, much of what was donated to MAPS . (turtle has a few of these gems)Without folks having admitted to LSD lists like these are useless IMHO... speculation posing as fact.
