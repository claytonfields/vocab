According to the Express, Arsenal are close to striking a deal for West Ham defender Winston Reid, with a fee supposedly agreed with just personal terms left to discuss.

West Ham manager Sam Allardyce seems desperate to keep the talented defender who's solid performances have seen West Ham soar to 4th in the Premier League, their best start to a season in over 30 years.

Arsenal however are in desperate need of defensive cover following several injuries to first team players Laurent Koscielny and Mathieu Debuchy leaving the side worryingly short at the back.

After another defensive slip that saw the Gunners throw away a 1-0 lead to lose 2-1 to Swansea in the Premier League, it seems the fans are either calling for Wenger's head or reinforcements in the January window.

Despite Arsene Wenger's stubbornness to spend following a string of embarrassing performances defensively the Gunner's manager might just be persuaded to reach into his pocket to bolster his side's faltering defence.

Reid would certainly add a different dimension to Arsenal's back line, as a very physical defender it would be hard to see Arsenal beaten in the air with Winston Reid and Per Mertesacker controlling the back line.

Much-Needed Bolstering

With vice-captain Mertesacker in poor form it would be a breath of fresh air to see a new defender at the club to replace the gaping hole left by ex-skipper Thomas Vermaelen, who left the club in the summer to join Spanish giants Barcelona.

Are we to see new signings for Arsenal in the January transfer window? Or are Arsenal fans set to be disappointed again by Wenger's refusal to spend?
