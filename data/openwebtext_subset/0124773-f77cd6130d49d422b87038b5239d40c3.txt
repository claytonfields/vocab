Prior to going gluten free I had never tried red velvet cake! I know how could I possibly go so long without ever trying one of the most delicious cakes on the planet? I don’t know but I am so glad I don’t have to ever live without it now. In fact I love it so much I am sharing three ways that you too can enjoy this fantastic treat. You can either have red velvet cake, cupcakes, or cake balls! Whichever way you decide to enjoy this cake you won’t be disappointed.

*Always be safe and re-read all ingredients. Manufacturers have a way of switching ingredients every now and then. Better safe than in pain :).

Red Velvet Cake

Gluten Free!!!

Ingredients

2 1/2 cups Bob’s Red Mill Gluten Free Biscuit and Baking Mix (or other all purpose gluten free flour)

1 1/2 cups Sugar

1 teaspoon Gluten Free Baking Soda

1 teaspoon salt

1 teaspoon cocoa powder

1 package Jell-O Devils Food Chocolate Pudding

1 1/2 cups vegetable oil

8oz Sour Cream

2 lg eggs

1 oz red food coloring

1 teaspoon white distilled vinegar

1 teaspoon gluten free vanilla extract

2 teaspoons milk

Cream Cheese Frosting (store bought)

*If making cake balls you will also want a bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips

Directions

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease cake pan, muffin pan, or cake ball pan. Depending on what you are making.

In a medium bowl sift flour, sugar, baking soda, salt, cocoa powder and Jell-O. Set aside.

In a large bowl beat eggs, oil, sour cream, vinegar, vanilla, and food coloring. Once mixed well add dry mixture to wet mixture slowly. Mix until blended. This is a thick batter. If it is to hard to move add 2 teaspoons of milk that should help a little. Try not to add more than 1 tablespoon. Thick is a good thing with this cake :).

Pour into prepared vessel.

Cake—Pour batter into cake pan place in preheated oven for 50-60 minutes. Or until done. Let cool then frost and enjoy!

Cupcakes—Pour batter into muffin pans place into preheated oven for 20-25 min. Or until done. Let cool then frost and enjoy!

Cake Balls (with pan)— Pour batter into cake ball pan place into preheated oven for 20-25 min. Or until done. Let cool then follow dipping instructions below.

Dipping Cake Balls: Melt chocolate chips over double boiler. Once chocolate has melted dip balls in. Then place back on wax paper covered cookie sheet. Once all balls are covered place back in fridge or freezer for chocolate to fully harden. Once the chocolate has hardened it’s time to enjoy! I dare you to try to eat just one!

Want cake balls but don’t have a cake ball pan? No worries. (*Note this makes a different kind of cake ball. It won’t be traditional cake since we add the cream cheese frosting and dip it in chocolate, it is going to be very sweet. Still wonderfully delicious just sweeter, more like a candy cake ball). You can make either cake or cupcakes (see above). It doesn’t matter which. Once cake/cupcakes are fully cooked allow to cool. Then crumble it up in a bowl and add cream cheese frosting, stir. You want it to stick together so that you can form balls. Keep adding frosting until it forms into a ball easily. Start rolling the “dough” into bite size balls and place on wax paper covered cookie sheet. Once you have rolled all the balls place in fridge or freezer for at least 1 hour. Then you are ready for dipping. Follow instructions above.
