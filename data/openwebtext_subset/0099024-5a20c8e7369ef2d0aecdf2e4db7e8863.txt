About

With most of my time spent remaking the game i loved to play when i was younger and at school, i have really noticed my passion for game designing and this project has taken me just over 3 years to make and i have hit a point where i can take it no further.

which for me is very sad but i am only just a designer, i have made contact with coders who would love to help with this project and get it finished aswel as music artist to make custom soundtracks for the game but sadly that funding so with this so to speak wall in front of me i have come here to kickstarter the last line of defence for my game to finally get finished, i just hope that some of you have played the original thing thing arena and would love to see a remake.

To all those who pledge i thank you from the bottom of my heart and promise to not let you down in bringing back a classic flashplayer game with a new and wonderful twist,
