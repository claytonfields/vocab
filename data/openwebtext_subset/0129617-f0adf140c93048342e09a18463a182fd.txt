It was a breakthrough season for Alex Iwobi last term as the 20-year-old attacking midfielder used his vision, skill and technique to force his way into Arsene Wenger's Arsenal side.

After a short summer break, the Nigeria international is now focused on making sure he remains part of the plans in north London, and he spoke exclusively to Bleacher Report about how he can maintain the hype:

Bleacher Report: What have you been up to this summer?

Alex Iwobi: "I went on holiday to Marbella with some friends just to take time to clear my mind because it was a hectic season—but I have been training as well to keep moving forward.



"I went on some runs with my friends on holiday, and we also have a schedule to follow from the club, so I try to stick to that and also do a few bits that I think will help me."

BR: How has pre-season been since you joined up with the club?

AI: "It's been hard. In the morning, we tend to do a lot of circuit training and some running with and without the ball.



"We also do possession drills which can be hard work—and then we will go into the gym to work on upper- or lower-body strength. Later on we might get the ball out for another session."

BR: That sounds tiring.

AI: "It is. There is one exercise that we have been doing that is so hard. They call them star runs.

"The cones are laid out in the shape of a star, and then you have to run against the clock. The coaches make the star bigger so that it becomes more difficult. It's hard."

BR: It must mean you need extra fuel to keep you going?

AI: "It definitely does. I have been taking on board so many carbs. So much rice and pasta. Yesterday I ate three plates of rice.

"It is hard, and I have noticed I have been going to bed much earlier. Sleep is very important, you need rest when you train hard."

BR: Tell us about the traits in your game.

AI: "I just aim to get forward as much as I can and create chances. Arsene Wenger has given me confidence to keep playing the way I want to and to push forward. If I was to choose one thing to improve, it would be my decision-making, but I'm young so there is time for that."

BR: What did you make of the Euros?

AI: "Well, I was a bit disappointed with England, but Wales really opened my eyes with their performances and how far they managed to go. It was a great example of what can happen when you play as a team. They actually reminded me a lot of Leicester."

BR: Was there anyone you particularly liked to watch?

AI: "Yeah, I would say Paul Pogba was my favourite player to watch. I know he didn't play too well in the final, but there is so much to his game. It's actually his work off the ball that impresses me the most. It was definitely something I noticed and was impressed by. I like watching players that I can learn from.

"Gylfi Sigurdsson also caught my eye. I already knew he was good, but he was even better than I thought."

BR: Do you watch a lot of football?

AI: "I prefer playing it—but when I do watch, it is to try to learn things that I can take into my game. So during the Euros, I also kept my eye on Antoine Griezmann. It was so interesting to try to work out how he found himself in so many good positions. He works hard and also gets lots of goals."

BR: Nigeria seem to have some good young talent coming through, and Ahmed Musa has just signed for Leicester City.

AI: "Yeah, he is a good player. I have played with him and one thing I can tell you for sure is that this guy is fast. I think he can do well in England because he is exactly what you want in a winger, he will go past people and can cross the ball well."

BR: What will you do from here as you head into the new season?

AI: "We are going on a pre-season tour, and I just hope to continue to show what I am capable of and continue to get games. I don't like to get ahead of myself or listen to rumours, so I just aim to work hard to get into the team.

"The manager has shown he is willing to give young players a chance, and he does give me confidence. So I am hopeful it will be a good year."
