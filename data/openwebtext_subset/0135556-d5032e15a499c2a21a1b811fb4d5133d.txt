Have you always wanted to learn more about the ships in Star Wars? Growing up a girl who wanted to be a pilot, this was one of my favorite parts of Star Wars. I won’t lie, I watched a young Anakin and daydreamed about pod-racing and I was also fascinated with all the ships in the Star Wars Universe.
