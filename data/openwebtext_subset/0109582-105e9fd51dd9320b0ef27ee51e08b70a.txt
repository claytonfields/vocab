For the arm sections in the body I used vac formed pieces (same as used on actual arms) and fitted them in with car body filler. The body was then lined with foil (this would reflect the light better once fitted)



Am access panel was cut into her back for fitting the neck etc.



For the neck once again is vac formed super clear styrene and frosted on the back. I laser cut stickers and stuck on a ring of angled squares that would be the neck glow. This was then attached in with car body filler.



In the head I used small pieces of styrene around the edges so that the face screen could be sat in but removable and lined with foil after spraying.



Everything was then primed with white primer and sprayed with several light layers of cellulose paint. To create the shine I didnt use lacquer as it can put a yellow tint on white things. I had put on several layers of paint so I could use 'micromesh', a super fine polishing sandpaper, to polish the whole head and body to a mirror shine (this took ages! but worth it).



The stickers were peeled off the neck.

Clear acrylic rods were fitted through the body to hold the head and arms.



A steel bar was fitted through the back so Eve could be attached to the wall to look like she was hovering.



Finally I put LED lights in her (Xmas lights for the body and a couple of small lantern torches in the head). The Xmas lights were great as they could be set to a pulse glow that was perfect for her.
