Obi-Wan: That boy is our last hope. Yoda: No. There is another. -- Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back On behalf of the Parrot team, I'm proud to announce Parrot 5.5.0, also known as "Salvadori's Fig Parrot". Parrot (http://parrot.org/) is a virtual machine aimed at running all dynamic languages. Parrot 5.5.0 is available on Parrot's FTP site (ftp://ftp.parrot.org/pub/parrot/releases/devel/5.5.0/), or by following the download instructions at http://parrot.org/download. For those who would like to develop on Parrot, or help develop Parrot itself, we recommend using Git to retrieve the source code to get the latest and best Parrot code. Parrot 5.5.0 News: - Build + Configure options are now allowed to be quoted. + Fixed build on Win32. + Updated location of NQP on Win32. + Fixed Parrot::Distribution detection. - Documentation + Noted that RESPONSIBLE_PARTIES is mostly out of date. - Tests + Stopped testing native PBC on 64bit LE, due to lack of access to such machine. - Release + Added tool: make_upload_commands.pl - Community + Parrot has been awarded 3 student slots in Google Summer of Code 2013!
