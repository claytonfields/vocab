On Thursday afternoon, the Green Bay Packers announced a few critical items regarding the team’s spring and summer practice schedule.

First, and perhaps most importantly, the Packers announced the dates for the start of training camp; Camp will begin on Wednesday, July 26th, with the first practice taking place the next day on July 27th. This comes two days after the Packers’ Shareholders Meeting, which was announced last week and will be held on Monday, July 24th.

The Packers will kick off training camp a bit later this year than they did last year. However, the start of 2016’s camp was accelerated due to the team’s participation in the Hall of Fame Game. (Of course, the game was cancelled due to poor field conditions brought about by issues with the paint on the turf.)

The team also revealed the dates of which practices during the spring offseason workouts will be open to the public. The full schedule for all practices can be found here, but the open practice dates are below:

OTAs: Tuesday May 23, Thursday June 1, Tuesday June 6

Minicamp: Tuesday June 13, Wednesday June 14, Thursday June 15

According to the team’s press release, all open practices are held at Clarke Hinkle Field. The OTA practices will be available for standing-room-only viewing from the fences on either side of the field, while fans can traditionally sit in the stands bordering the practice field for minicamp practices.

Stay tuned in the coming weeks, as the Packers typically announce the full practice schedule for training camp around the conclusion of minicamp.
