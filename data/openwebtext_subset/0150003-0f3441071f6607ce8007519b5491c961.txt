The Arkansas Razorbacks have added the San Jose State Spartans to their 2019 football schedule, WholeHogSports has reported.

Arkansas will host San Jose State in either Fayetteville or Little Rock on Sept. 21, 2019. The game will be the first-ever meeting between the two schools.

The addition of San Jose State gives Arkansas three non-conference opponents in 2019. The Razorbacks are also scheduled to host Portland State on Aug. 31 and Colorado State on Sept. 14.

In SEC play in 2019, Arkansas will host Auburn, Mississippi State, Missouri, and Texas A&M (in Arlington, TX) and travel to play Alabama, LSU, Ole Miss, and Kentucky.

San Jose State has now tentatively completed their 2019 non-conference schedule with the addition of Arkansas. The Spartans are also slated to host Tulsa (Sept. 7) and travel to California (Sept. 14) and Army (Oct. 19).

Mountain West opponents for San Jose State in 2019 include Boise State, Fresno State, New Mexico, and San Diego State at home and Air Force, Hawaii, Nevada, and UNLV on the road.
