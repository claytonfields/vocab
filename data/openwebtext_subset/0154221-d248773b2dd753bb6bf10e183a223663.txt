Does the destination actually interest you?

There would be nothing worse than booking a cruise solely because the price dropped to 50% and then discovering that nothing about that destination interests you at all. Instead put a little bit of research into where you want to go based on what interests you. Otherwise you might feel like you wasted your money and vacation time.

With so many online resources out there today, from personal blogs to travel sites, there’s no reason why you can’t find your dream destination.

Is the destination affordable as a cruise vacation?

Cruising is a great way to get a feel for a country, but it certainly doesn’t allow you to the time to sink into the local culture. Most cruises generally give you one day, occasionally two, in each port. This means any port excursions you have planned or things you would like to do have to be crammed into a short amount of time.

That being said, cruises provide a lot of value for the cost. Longer cruises can take you to upwards of five different countries with various world voyages taking you to over twenty!

Consider cost, convenience, and what kind of traveler you want to be. Are you the type of person who wants everything taken care of? Or are you a backpacker who enjoys going where the wind blows you? Would you rather book a cruise, which has all meals and accommodation included, but keeps you stuck to a set schedule, or would you enjoy booking a flight, hotel, and rental car so that you could explore your destination based on your own time frame. And which option costs more?

It all depends on what your travels style is.
