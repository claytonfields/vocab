UFC on Fox 15: Machida vs. Rockhold was an event that saw a multitude of lower ranked fighters defeat their higher ranked counterparts. This resulted in a lot of movement in this week’s official UFC Rankings.

In his most impressive performance in the UFC, Luke Rockhold defeated former UFC Light-Heavywight Champion Lyoto Machida, and moved up three spots from #4 to the #1 spot in the Middlewight division.

Although Jacare Souza won his fight in dominate fashion, a win against Chris Camozzi doesn’t compare to defeating Lyoto Machida, as Souza dropped from the #1 spot to #2 at middleweight. Lyoto Machida dropped from #2 to #4.

The breakout star of the event was Max Holloway as he dominated the higher ranked Cub Swanson. Holloway moved to #6 at featherweight, while Swanson surprisingly stayed at #5.

Paige VanZant also had a breakout performance, dominating veteran Felice Herrig. She had the biggest jump in the rankings, moving up 5 spots to #7 in the woman’s strawweight division. Herrig fell down three spots to #11 .

Ovince St. Preux’s 1st round KO of Patrick Cummins did not give him too much of a boost in the rankings, as he stayed at #7 at light-heavyweight. Cummins fell a spot couple to #13 .

Beniel Dariush makes his debut in the UFC rankings after putting on a grapping showcase against the former #12 ranked lightweight Jim Miller. Dariush is ranked at #14 , while Miller has fallen off of the rankings.

There was no movement in the Pound-for-Pound rankings as no fighter within the Top 15 fought. Even though Rockhold and Souza are ranked higher at middleweight, fighters Anderson Silva and Vitor Belfort continue to hold their P4P ranking.
