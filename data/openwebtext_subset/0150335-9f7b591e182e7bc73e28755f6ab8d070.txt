True Pundit released a promising piece earlier which shows John McCain's Great-Great Grandfather is indeed tied to the first Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan.

<a href="https://truepundit.com/john-mccains-great-great-grandfather-was-confederate-soldier-served-under-first-grand-wizard-of-kkk-video/"><h4>John McCain’s Great-Great Grandfather Was Confederate Soldier; Served Under First Grand Wizard of KKK (Video)</h4></a>

<blockquote>”Sen. John McCain lashed out at President Donald Trump this week for not “standing up to defy hate and bigotry” after the disastrous riots in Virginia that killed one woman and injured dozens more.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>”McCain has made it a habit of slamming Trump on just about everything the President does or plans to do. His criticism this week proved little more than another barb from the self-appointed racially-righteous choir of politicians, entertainers and athletes. But McCain doesn’t have such a squeaky-clean family lineage when it comes to maintaining the racial high ground.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>”McCain’s great-great grandfather fought for the Confederacy in the Civil War as a private for the Mississippi Cavalry division. The elder McCain’s unit served missions at the pleasure of Lieutenant General Nathan Bedford Forrest. Considered a brilliant military strategist, Forrest was a real estate investor, slave trader and better known as the first Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. Forrest was a founding father of the KKK.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>”McCain also was a war deserter and was eventually captured as a prisoner of war.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>”Glass houses.”</blockquote>

So Liberals, and Black Lives Matter who have repeatedly attacked the President of the United States of America while praising McCain as some sort of hero, will you now disavow?

The New Yorker wrote an astounding piece on McCain once, where James Carroll spoke of his past interviews where John McCain himself has admitted to him that he's no hero.

<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-true-nature-of-john-mccains-heroism"><h4>The True Nature of John McCain’s Heroism</h4></a>

<blockquote>“He's not a war hero,” Donald Trump said two years ago, speaking at a Republican Party candidates’ forum in Iowa. “He’s a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren’t captured.” Trump’s insult to Senator John McCain—and, by extension, to every American P.O.W.—drew a gasp of rebuke from across the political spectrum. The initial indignation, however, did not last; in hindsight, it seems one of the final instances of a broad cultural unity that now seems lost to this country forever.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The reason for the universal, if brief, repugnance was obvious: McCain’s conduct during nearly six years in a North Vietnamese prison, the infamous Hanoi Hilton, had become the stuff of legend. In 1968, less than a year after his Navy bomber was shot down, the imprisoned McCain was abruptly offered unconditional release by the North Vietnamese, perhaps because his father had just been named the commander of U.S. forces in the Pacific. McCain was still badly crippled from his crash and the poor medical treatment that followed, yet he adhered to the P.O.W. code of honor and refused to be repatriated ahead of American prisoners who had been in captivity longer than he. His refusal was adamant. His guard told him, “Now, McCain, it will be very bad for you.” He was tortured for his defiance, and ultimately spent more than two years in solitary confinement. The abuse, combined with the after-effects of his injuries, left him physically marked. He could have avoided it all, but out of loyalty and—one has to name it—love for his comrades, he chose not to.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“One of the peculiarities of Trump’s constant outrages is the way in which, every now and then, they accidentally bring to the surface deep matters of meaning and morality. In fact, the future President was partly correct in Iowa, though not in the way he supposed; McCain never considered himself a war hero. More than twenty years ago, I interviewed him for the magazine, and I remember as if it were yesterday the anguish that came into his face when he described the worst part of his imprisonment. A son and grandson of Navy admirals, he was raised with a steely sense of martial honor. As he experienced it, he grotesquely betrayed that honor when, under the pressures of torture, he broke. He abjectly signed a “confession” declaring him a “black criminal” and an “air pirate.” To himself, after that, McCain was a traitor to his nation and his family. Returned to his cell guilt-ridden and despondent, he came close to suicide. This misery outweighed any possible sense of valor he might have derived from the stalwart resistance that actually defined his time in captivity, and that others would simplistically see as grand heroism.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“What McCain did in refusing release from the Hanoi Hilton ennobled him, but his survival of the moral collapse that his captors forced on him was, arguably, the precondition of the further heroic work he accomplished years later. The memory of the Vietnam War, that self-inflicted American wound, festered for decades after the nominal end of hostilities, in 1975. The United States, nursing its trauma, imagined itself as the war’s victim, and punished the victorious but impoverished Vietnamese with a crippling economic embargo. Justifying this vengeful spirit and exacerbating it was the false belief that dozens, or perhaps hundreds, of Americans were still being held in secret P.O.W. camps in the jungles of Southeast Asia—a grim fiction that was promoted by the “Rambo” films, jingoists such as Ross Perot, and politicians including Ronald Reagan and Bob Dole. Thousands of bereft family members were encouraged to anticipate the eventual return of loved ones who were, in fact, long dead. Their icon was the black P.O.W./M.I.A. flag, with the silhouette of a man beneath a guard tower.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“It took the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W./M.I.A. Affairs, chaired by John Kerry, to lay the myth to rest, in 1993. The group’s difficult finding—that there was no evidence that any Americans had been held back in Vietnamese prisons—was agreed to unanimously by all members, across the political divide, from far right to far left. It was a truly bipartisan outcome, one of those increasingly infrequent moments in which facts vanquished ideology on Capitol Hill. No one was more central to that blazingly controversial effort than John McCain. By dismantling the last pillar of American contempt for Vietnam, McCain, in partnership with Kerry, led the way to the lifting of the embargo, the diplomatic recognition of Vietnam, and the true end of the war. The friendship that developed between the famously anti war Kerry, whose protests had been despised by the prisoners in Hanoi, and the lionized patriot McCain became a hopeful example of American reconciliation. McCain’s capacity for magnanimity was grounded in his refusal to regard himself as morally superior. That he was no hero to himself was what made him the hero America actually needed.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Alas, the golden moment of rational bipartisanship did not last. Though it laid the groundwork for prosperity in Vietnam, it was soon undermined in America by a sequence of political jolts—the Gingrich revolution, the Clinton scandals, the politicization of the Supreme Court with Bush v. Gore, and the fake-news swift-boating of Kerry himself. After 9/11 and the Bush wars, in particular, the nation’s old wound opened wide again. (Indeed, the black P.O.W./M.I.A. flag, emblem of U.S. victimhood, still flies everywhere.) McCain, in the grip of inherited martial fervor, was a cheerleader for Bush’s misadventures, and finally he, too, was undone by the renewed collapse of American common sense and common decency. Sarah Palin, the running mate he chose in his 2008 bid for the Presidency, turned out to be the drum major marching just ahead of Trump’s parade.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“There is a painful irony in McCain’s having served, by the insult done to him at that Iowa candidates’ forum, as one of the pivot points on which the national narrative has turned. He showed that Trump could mock self-sacrifice, could demean honor, and blithely get away with it, even among those who should most have found it unforgivable. Now that the Arizona senator has received the heartbreaking news of his brain-cancer diagnosis, recalling Ted Kennedy and Beau Biden, it is urgently important that Trump not have the last word. McCain’s admirable loyalty to his fellow-prisoners—and, by extension, to the nation—was in no way undone, as he himself feared, by his having been overwhelmed by torture. On the contrary, being stripped in captivity of moral self-righteousness as well as physical health prepared him to emerge at the crucial moment as a figure of American redemption, of aspirational nobility—even if the nation lately falls far short of the standards set fifty and twenty years ago by Senator John McCain.”</blockquote>

Yes, John McCain is no hero. In fact he's far from it.

He's admitted before to bombing innocent children and he also used racial slurs calling the Vietnamese “gooks” during his Presidential bid.

It's more common than not with McCain to have said horrendous things, that in modern times most Americans, especially those on the left are unaware of.

Here's an article from 2008, from a Democrat, who explains his disgust with John McCain the bigoted and criminal warmonger in a News One piece.

<a href="https://newsone.com/942/the-real-john-mccain-vietnam-story/"><h4>The Real John McCain Vietnam Story</h4></a>

<blockquote>”Much has been made about John McCain’s war heroism. Even his opponent Barack Obama has gone out of his way to praise McCain’s patriotism and heroism. America has a long tradition of electing war heroes, from George Washington to Ulysses S. Grant to John F Kennedy. Unlike Washington Grant and Kennedy who fought in the Revolutionary war Civil War and World War II, McCain fought in a war that was highly unpopular and viewed as unnecessary.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The Revolutionary War gave the U.S. independence, the Civil War ended slavery, WWII saved the world from Hitler’s domination and ended the genocide of the European jews. What exactly was accomplished by the Vietnam War other than the deaths of thousands of U.S. soldiers and millions of Vietnamese soldiers and civilians? Most non-neocons would agree that the Vietnamese war was an ideologically based war for the US empire of capitalism against the communists.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Fighting in a war does not make you a hero. Were the Nazi soldiers heroes? Were confederate soldiers heroes? Part of being a hero is fighting for a good cause that saves lives and makes the world a better place not taking lives and making it a worse one. Unfortunately for our soldiers, it is not them who decide whether they are heroes, villains or victims of the wars they fight but up to the leaders who wage the wars. Most of the soldiers who fought in Vietnam did not want to fight in the war at all and were drafted, victims of their government’s imperialist warmongering policies. McCain on the other hand volunteered for the war, marking the 1st time he followed his president to an idiotic war.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Unlike Kennedy, John McCain did not fight on the front lines, instead flying a plane and bombing strategic targets and the occasional innocent civilian. McCain participated in Rolling Thunder, an Operation that dropped hundreds of tons of bombs on Vietnam. By all accounts, Mccain was an unqualified, incompetent pilot Given that Vietnam did not have an air force it is unlikely that McCain engaged in any Top Gun like aerial maneuvers.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“McCain’s plane was shot down by antiaircraft fire in 1967. He parachuted into a lake and was saved by a Vietnamese peasant who fought off an angry mob that wanted to kill him. If someone were to bomb a power plant in the US and had their planes shot down they would be seen as a terrorist. I doubt any American would pull him out the Hudson river and save him from an angry mob, Americans would call for his execution and justify his torture.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“When McCain’s plane was shot down he wasn’t bombing any military target at all just a power plant in Hanoi with a team of 20 planes that were made to shut down vietnam’s infrastructure. Millions of Vietnamese civilians were killed by American bombs from planes like McCain’s. In 1997, on 60 Minutes McCain said ‘I am a war criminal, I bombed innocent women and children.’”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Unlike the many Arab prisoners in Guantanamo bay and Abu Ghraib, McCain quickly cracked under the pressure of his captors. Giving up all relevant information he had and issuing a statement, “I am a black criminal and I have performed the deeds of a war pirate…I almost died and the Vietnamese people saved my life thanks to the doctors” he said.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“In a time where we can clearly see the negative effects of a war-mongering president on the economy and foreign policy, McCain seems a bad choice for president. McCain’s history as a bomber and his disregard for civilian casualties make him an ideal candidate for continuing Bush’s foreign policies. If anything his experience in Vietnam have made him more mean-spirited. On his tour bus in 2000 McCain said “I hate gooks, I will hate them all my life” He has called his wife a cunt and cursed out several senators who disagreed with him.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“A true patriot follows his country to war when it is absolutely necessary and leads his country away from war when he is not. McCain is a war villain and a war criminal, not a hero. Muhammed Ali was a hero for standing up for his beliefs and refusing to go to the Vietnam war. The many people who risked their freedom to protest the Vietnam war are heroes. People like John Kerry who fought in the war and then came back to reveal the atrocities to the American people were heroes. People like John McCain who voluntarily fought an illegal, immoral war and admitted to killing innocent civilians in the cause of spreading capitalism and eliminating communism are not at all.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“<a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc/20000103/dreyfuss/2">In 1967 an accident involving a napalm bomb on a Navy ship lead to the deaths of 134 soldiers</a>. After it, McCain told the New York Times: “Now that I’ve seen what the bombs and napalm did to the people on our ship, I’m not so sure that I want to drop any more of that stuff on North Vietnam.” He kept bombing even when other pilots refused to take place in the bombing until his plane was shot down.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“I’m sure Obama will stay clear of criticizing McCain’s war experience and continue to praise him on his service. However, I’m sure that others will attack his patriotism and war experience. Being a veteran or P.O.W. does not qualify you for the presidency, especially in a time where war-mongering and disregard for civilian casualties have led to abysmal international relations for the US and its lowest popularity rating since Vietnam.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“If America really wants to have another Vietnam, another draft, billions more dollars taken away from our schools, health care system given to our military to kill civilians abroad then we should elect John McCain. John McCain is an admitted war criminal who still hates “gooks” and wants to bomb Iran, with no regard for the deaths of innocent civilians. In 2001 Mccain said “I hated my enemies even before they held me captive because hate sustained me in my devotion to their complete destruction and helped me overcome the virtuous human impulse to recoil in disgust from what had to be done by my hand.” Is this the kind of man we want in charge of our armed forces?”</blockquote>

The author was correct then, and he's correct now. John McCain is an evil, cowardly traitor, and he deserves zero legitimate respect from either side of the aisle.
