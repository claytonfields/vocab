Yesterday we stopped by EPCOT’s Norway Pavilion to see how much progress has been made on the new Frozen Ever After attraction the the Royal Sommerhus meet and greet area. Both areas are expected to officially open on June 21st and it looks like Disney’s Imagineers are hurriedly putting on some final details. Are you ready to enter the world of Anna & Elsa?

Frozen Ever After, of course, replaces the former Maelstrom boat ride through Norwegian folklore. You’ll keep the same boats, but instead follow all your favorite Frozen characters (Queen Elsa, Anna, Olaf, Kristoff, Sven) in events directly following the movie.

The courtyard facade had been behind a large tarp, but that’s now been taken down and we can see a big difference from its former look.

In addition to the new beautiful castle facade, we also have a new building with a sign that reads, “Bryggestredet Kjolelager.” Roughly translated, that means a Dress Warehouse. The building appears to be inspired by a building in Bergen, Norway on Bryggestredet street.

You’ll also note that, as we suspected, the old hole that overlooked the waterfalls has been closed. No more going ‘back, back, over the falls’ I guess.

Over to the meet and greet area of the Royal Sommerhus we see that the buildings look pretty much done. A couple have glorious ‘grass’ roofs others with slate. They’re still putting a few floral details on the old castle ruins behind the building facades.

I do have some sad news to report. The Mexico margarita stand is now closed and scheduled for demolition. Turns out it was just too close to the new Norway expansion and the theming overlapped too much. Frozen margaritas will return to Mexico, just in a different location.

Will you be planning a trip to Arendelle to visit the world of Frozen?
