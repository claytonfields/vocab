Continental have been advertising that their high-end tires are handmade in Germany for a few years now, but how do you go about making tires by hand? With a frame, at least an aluminum one, you know what to expect - itâ€™s been put together by a man with some welding experience and a hammer. But a tire, well, that just had us stumped. So when Continental invited us up to their headquarters in Korbach, Northern Germany, we jumped at the chance to see the procedure firsthand.We followed their production process from design and prototyping, right through to the finished tires that you can buy off the shelf, but you'll probably notice that we don't show the same tire throughout the article. This is because the production line manufacturers different tires on different days, and we were lucky enough to catch it as that change was happening. The fact is that the same process is used for all of the tires made within the walls of the Korbach plant - just the sizings, rubber compounds and materials () obviously change between the road models and World Cup-ready downhill tires.Stay tuned to Pinkbike as we'll have an exclusive first test of the new Rammstein downhill tire next week.
