New Hero: Zarya

Aleksandra Zaryanova is one of the world's strongest women and was a promising athlete, but all that changed when the Siberian omnium reawakened. As a soldier in the Russian Defense Force, she now proudly uses her strength to protect the ones she loves.

Assassin

Abilities

Arcane Orb (W) Beginning size reduced by roughly 33% Maximum size reduced by roughly 33% Explosion radius reduced by roughly 15%



Talents

Level 4 Triumvirate (W) Now reduces the cooldown of Arcane Orb by 50%, instead of 5 seconds Travel distance required reduced from 65 to 50%

Level 7 Zei's Vengeance (W) Added functionality: Now also reduces the cooldown of Arcane Orb by 25%



Developer Comments: Arcane Orb and the Talents affecting it have been slightly underperforming over the past couple months. We are also unhappy with the unpredictably large explosion radius that occurs at close range detonations. To address these concerns, we have made some base size adjustments to the Orb missile while also buffing Zei’s Vengeance to help round out the full build. While the size changes definitely look like a nerf on paper, in actual testing we felt like they gave players tighter control with a lot less early-detonations on unintended targets.

Return

Tychus

Stats

Base Maximum Health increased from 1836 to 1925

Base Health Regeneration increased from 3.8 to 4

Talents

Level 1 Press the Advantage (E) Basic Attack Range bonus increased from 25 to 35% Combat Tactician (E) Cooldown reduction increased from .75 to .8 seconds per Basic Attack. Shrug It Off (E) Removed



Developer Comments: After the change the Relentless Soldier in a previous patch, Tychus had 2 different ways to gain Resistant. While we like that Tychus is a “tanky Assassin”, we felt that him having more ways to mitigate damage than some melee Assassins to be too much. We decided to remove Shrug It Off because it felt misplaced on a tier that was primarily about Utility and Mobility. To compensate for the loss of Shrug It Off, we’ve decided to buff his baseline Health and Regeneration and the other Talent options at level 1.

Developer Comments: Nazeebo is one of the oldest Heroes in the game, and his Talent tree was in dire need of an upgrade. The goal of the revamp was to increase the reward of mastering the Hero’s Abilities, maintain his identity as a zone control and damage over time character, embrace the fun mini-game that was Death Ritual, and provide interesting synergies between Abilities and Talents. We wanted to be sure to reinforce the designed weaknesses of the Hero that are lack of burst and lack of mobility, while still making him viable in the current metagame of Heroes of the Storm. Overall, a lot of his old Talents had to be revamped or replaced, but we find that he still feels a lot like the old Nazeebo, just more interesting!

Entangling Roots (E) Increased range by roughly 12% Delay before initial root reduced from .5 seconds to .25 seconds

Talents

Level 1 Harmony (Q) Removed

Level 4 Rampant Growth (Q) Healing bonus reduced from 50 to 40%

Level 7 Enduring Growth (Q) Removed



Developer Comments: While we realize that Malfurion’s talent tree could use some work, and we want to do a deeper dive in the future, we wanted to give him a better niche among our other Support heroes in the meantime. His throughput healing should be higher, and a bigger part of his gameplay should now be rolling his heal-over-time effects among multiple allies to keep them alive. He now also has the unique ability to give allies cooldown reduction in addition to Mana, which should give him a new reason to be considered being added to a team. We’ve also buffed the initial root search for his Entangling Roots, which will enable him to more reliably root enemy Heroes instead of relying on his teammates to secure crowd control.

Developer Comments: We know how much passion our players have for Chen and spent months upgrading his Talent Tree to our newest philosophies. To give you an idea of what we were looking to improve, here were a couple of our goals with this update: Chen should be able to be a solo-tank for your team and not be afraid to constantly soak enemy skill-shots. Chen should be a constant threat to the enemy’s backline damage dealers. Chen should deal low amounts of burst damage while continually applying sustained damage at pointed targets. Chen should be extremely resilient in the absence of enemy stuns. As always, we are listening to your feedback and appreciate everyone taking the time to send it to us. Enjoy the new Talent Tree, and as Chen has said many times before- “It is important to master the Brew and not let it master you!”

Developer Comments: We like E.T.C.’s core gameplay, but wanted to improve his talent diversity. Many E.T.C. players end up picking the same talents in most games, especially at Levels 1 and 4, due to the importance of buffing Powerslide. We’ve streamlined that power, and have given him more options to play up the bard aspect of his kit, which should make him more of a team player.
