Jon Stewart’s last Daily Show was much more than just a cameo-packed, Springsteen-soundtracked, emotion-infused blow-out. The legendary host’s final episode was also a financial lightning rod for an excellent cause.

Stewart partnered with charity fundraising platform Omaze to raise money for New York Collaborates for Autism. Donors who gave $10 or more were entered in a drawing to attend The Daily Show’s final taping, meet Stewart and hang out on the set. More than 47,000 people from 78 countries donated, generating a whopping $2.23 million for NYCA.

Here’s the complete donation breakdown:

—Total Raised: $2,235,520

—Winning Donation: $100

—Number of Donors: 47,048

—Number of Countries: 78

—Average Donation Amount: $45.50

—Average Amount Raised Per Day: $14,707

—Highest Donation: $35,000

Here’s Stewart with the drawing’s big winner, Sameer:

“Over the last 16 years, no one has done more than Jon to engage people around the issues that truly impact our lives,” said Matt Pohlson, Omaze’s co-founder, “and it’s fitting that he leveraged his final show to raise more than $2 million for this incredible cause.” Pohlson took to Instagram to voice his admiration for Stewart, posting a photo of the two working together.
