The movie will begin principal photography in British Columbia.

Nicolas Cage is joining The Humanity Bureau.

Minds Eye Entertainment, VMI Worldwide and Bridgegate Pictures are partnering for the movie, which is being directed by Rob King from a script written by Dave Schultz.

Principal photography is set to begin this week in British Columbia, and is being shot for a multiscreen, panoramic format.

Set in the year 2030, the movie takes place after global warming has destroyed the American Midwest and follows a government agency (The Humanity Bureau) that exiles people deemed unproductive and banishes them to a colony known as New Eden.

Cage plays a caseworker who is trying to appeal the banishment of a single mother (Sarah Lind) and her son (Jakob Davies).

Cage was recently seen in Oliver Stone's Snowden and opposite Willem Dafoe in Paul Schrader's Dog Eat Dog. He is repped by CAA, Link and Bloom Hergott.
