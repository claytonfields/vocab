Will we ever be able to go even one week without some incident of racism aimed at Aboriginal people hitting the papers? This is the question I am currently asking myself. Barely a day has gone by lately where I haven't had someone asking for my views on something racist someone else has said or done. The emotional labour of continually having these conversations is taxing, yet I have no hopes of it letting up soon.

On Sunday morning, I woke to the news that an AFL fan threw a banana at Aboriginal player Eddie Betts while referring to him as a monkey during an Adelaide versus Port Adelaide game on Saturday. It appears that some opposition fans simply cannot abide a high-performing Aboriginal player and must therefore remind him of his place in society.

Eddie Betts was called a "monkey" and had a banana thrown at him, but people question whether it was racially motivated.

While it is heartening that the club has acted swiftly to punish the woman responsible by revoking her club membership, I'm left wondering if anything was learnt from Adam Goodes' experience of similar crowd behaviour. Port Adelaide, after all, have stated that they will place a life ban on her IF her actions are found to be racially-motivated, as if this fact is somehow murky.

Mere days earlier, performance artist Marina Abramovic was in the firing line after diary entries from 1979 were released detailing her then-impression of Aboriginal people she had encountered. These diary entries are being compiled to form her memoirs. Her observations were undoubtedly crude, referring to Aboriginal people as looking like "dinosaurs" while also passing comment about our stick-like legs and round torsos.
