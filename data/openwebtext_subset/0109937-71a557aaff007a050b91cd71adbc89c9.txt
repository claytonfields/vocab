Twins are a rare occurrence in any family. What makes Lauren and Hayleigh Durrant such a unique set of twins though, is that while identical, their skin and hair colors are in fact different. While Lauren is light skinned, with blue eyes and red hair, like her mother; her sister Hayleigh has dark skin and dark hair like their father. It's believed that different sperm carrying genes for lighter or darker skin tones fertilized two of the eggs, resulting in the difference in skin, hair and eye color. The phenomena is believed to be so rare that there's no real data to determine the probability.

That being said, when the girls' parents, Allison and Dean, were expecting again, it became a running joke that they might again end up with twins on opposite ends of the skin color spectrum. However, they were shocked when this became a reality and Allison gave birth to yet another set of twins, Miya and Leah, who both had differing skin and hair colors, just like their older sisters. While everyone else seems to be making a fuss over the girls' varying colors, Hayleigh and Lauren don't think much of it. They're just happy to have their siblings and to "have more people to care about in your family."
