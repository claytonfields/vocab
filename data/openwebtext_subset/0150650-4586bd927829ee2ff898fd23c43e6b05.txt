This is a collab with the wonderful Discorded

who helped a lot while making this. It was very fun to work on and I think the idea turned out pretty cute. Itâ€™s not super original, but I guess it does twist the theme a little bit.

Also featured as the header for Equestria Daily's Morning Discussion #591! And again in Equestria Daily's Derpy Day 2017 Drawfriend (Part 3)! Pony mending fences / Pony fencing

Unfortunately, this is a WIP and the intent was to add a bit of shading and polish. I was highly against uploading this on my account because I think the person who did the most on it should do it but Discorded adamantly refused so here we are. Hopefully we'll find some time in the future to update it a little bit more and maybe add some shading.
