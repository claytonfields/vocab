According to a new CBO report, participation in food stamp programs is at an all-time high. But, don't you dare call President Obama the "food stamp president!"

Spending on SNAP benefits grew by about 135 percent between 2007 and 2011 ... About 65 percent of growth came from an increase in the number of people receiving benefits. That increase was driven primarily by the weak economy.

About 20 percent of growth can be attributed to temporarily higher benefit amounts. That increase was legislated in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.

The final 15 percent of growth stems from other factors, such as higher food prices and lower income among beneficiaries, both of which boosted benefits.

To hear Obama's Keynesian-enthusiast USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack tell it, food stamps are the most direct stimulus you can get in this economy, or something -- so, along with the Obama administration's many other highly-lauded 'stimulus' projects, where exactly are these correspondingly heightened employment figures we were promised?
