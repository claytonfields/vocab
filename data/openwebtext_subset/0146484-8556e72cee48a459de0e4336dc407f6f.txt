Mario Kart meets Micro Machines on the explosive tracks of BlazeRush—and now’s the perfect time to put the pedal to the metal. Mark your calendars for the BlazeRush Free Weekend, running from 7:00 am PT on May 26 to 6:00 pm PT on May 29 on the Oculus Store!

All game modes will be free to play, so you can get your fill of this adrenaline-fueled arcade racing game. Cut off the competition, run them off the road, or blow them up in online and local multiplayer. A variety of tracks, obstacles, and enemies keep things interesting, while voice chat lets you trash talk like a pro.

As an added bonus, you can also buy the game at a special discount for a limited time. Check out the Oculus Store on May 26 for details.

No levels. No health. No brakes. See if you have what it takes to survive as the fast-paced mayhem unfolds.

We’ll see you on the track.
