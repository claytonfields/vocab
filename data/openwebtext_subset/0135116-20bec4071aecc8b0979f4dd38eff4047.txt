About the Product

Here at last, the background and practical application of the unique and powerful Japanese charting techniques–known as candlestick charts–are fully explained for the first time. These colorful and exciting techniques are hot on the lips of leading analysts and traders worldwide.

The overwhelming response to the author’s first Japanese candlestick article in Futures magazine, interviews of him by the Wall Street Journal and the L.A. Times, and numerous television appearances, in addition to the many charting services now offering candlestick programs to their clients, have all made it apparent that a comprehensive explanation of candlestick charts is sorely needed. Here it is–an inside look at the technical tools refined by over 100 years of use in Japan. Candlestick charts are older than bar charts, older than point-and-figure charts, and yet, they are virtually unknown in the West–until now.

Completely informative and global in its outlook, Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques provides the first -in-depth explanation of candlestick plotting and analysis in English. This exciting book exposes the reader to the author’s years of study, research, and practical experience in this increasingly popular and dynamic area.

Hundreds of examples that span the futures, fixed-income, equity, and foreign exchange markets show how candlestick techniques can be used in all of today’s markets. Through such patterns as the “dark cloud cover” and “hanging-man lines” the reader will discover how candlestick techniques provide unique market insights that are unavailable anywhere else.
