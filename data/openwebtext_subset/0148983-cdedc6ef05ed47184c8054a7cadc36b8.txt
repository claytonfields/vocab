From RAD Studio Code Examples

This sample shows how to integrate and use REST services in your application by using the Spitcast API in a C++ application.

Location

You can find the SurfSpotFinderApp sample project at:

Start | Programs | Embarcadero RAD Studio Berlin | Samples and then navigate to: CPP\Multi-Device Samples\Cloud\SurfSpot Finder

and then navigate to: Subversion Repository: C++: http://sourceforge.net/p/radstudiodemos/code/HEAD/tree/branches/RADStudio_Berlin/CPP/Multi-Device%20Samples/Cloud/SurfSpot%20Finder



Description

The application connects to the REST service from Spitcast to retrieve the list of Surf spots (sea locations for surfing). The application creates a main form that has a TMultiView component. The TMultiView component contains a list of Surf spots. Select a Surf spot from the SurfSpot finder list in order to display its location info: Location, Longitude and County. Each location info is displayed on an item of a TListBox. The sample also uses a TPanel with a TWebBrowser component for displaying the location on google maps.

Note: Public distribution of Spitcast API content must acknowledge Spitcast as the content source, and provide a link to spitcast.com. The Spitcast API is available for non-commercial use. Commercial use is possible by prior arrangement.

How to Use the Sample

Navigate to the location given above and open CppSurfSpotApp.cbproj . Select the target platform. Press F9 or choose Run > Run .

Files

File Contains CppSurfSpotApp.cbproj

CppSurfSpotApp.cpp The project itself. MainUnit.h

MainUnit.cpp

MainUnit.fmx The main form.

Classes

TForm4, the form class, implements the main visual component of the application. It contains a TMultiView component and a TPanel with a TWebBrowser component for displaying the location on a map. It also contains the following components: TRESTClient, TRESTResponse, TRESTRequest, and TRESTResponseDataSetAdapter.

Implementation

For the TMultiView1 component, in the Object Inspector , set the TargetControl property to Panel1 and the MasterButton property to backbtn .

, set the TargetControl property to and the MasterButton property to . For the RESTClient1 component, in the Object Inspector set the BaseURL property to http://api.spitcast.com .

set the BaseURL property to . For the RESTRequest1 component, in the Object Inspector set the following properties: The Client property to RESTClient1 . The Response property to RESTResponse1 . The Resource property to api/spot/all . The Method property to rmGET . Right-click the RESTRequest1 component and click Execute .

set the following properties: For the RESTResponseDataSetAdapter component, in the Object Inspector set the following properties: The Response property to RESTResponse1 . The Dataset property to FDMemTable1 .

set the following properties: Right-click the FDMemTable and select Fields Editor . Right-click the Fields Editor , select Add Fields and the fields county_name , latitude , longitude , spot_id , and spot_name .

. For the TMultiView1 component, visually bind the Surf Spots list from the Spitcats API call.
