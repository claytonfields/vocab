NEWCASTLE have made their first move to bolster next season’s roster by recruiting Melbourne Victory defender Daniel Georgievski. Georgievski, 29, has agreed to a two-year deal. He has played in 62 A-League games, including 19 this season, and featured in Victory’s 2014-15 grand final-winning team. He has also played in 22 internationals for Macedonia and spent two seasons with Romanian heavyweights FC Steaua Bucuresti. "He is an out-and out fullback,’’ Jets coach Mark Jones told the Newcastle Herald. “He has represented his country, won a championship and is excited to be coming to the club. "He is a good athlete, physical, has aggression, is a leader, is strong in the air and has a presence. "When we have been under pressure and needed someone to step up, no one has been able to. “With his experience, he will help us perform under pressure. He is the first step in strengthening the squad. "We are not short of people who want to come to the club because of the style of football we play. "We play out from the back, we can counter attack and we can play possession football.”
