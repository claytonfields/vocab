We come to it at last, the great battle of our time. Well maybe not our time, but this season, for sure. The Big 12 standings are tight. TCU currently leads with an 11-4 record. Texas Tech and West Virginia are just two games back. Kansas is only a single game further back. Oklahoma is currently 6-6, but has played one fewer conference series than everyone else. We look at the schedule over the next two weekends involving these teams.

April 28th Games

TCU @ Texas Tech

Oklahoma @ West Virginia

Baylor @ Kansas

The biggest series this weekend is obviously in Lubbock, with the first top-10 matchup in conference play. TCU can take a large lead over the Red Raiders with a series win. We’ll look more in depth at this matchup later this week. The Mountaineers will need to win their series over the Sooners to keep up as Tech or TCU will get at least two wins. Is Kansas for real? How about Baylor? The series in Lawrence might finally answer the biggest question in the Big 12 this season.

May 5th Games

Texas Tech @ West Virginia

Texas @ TCU

Oklahoma @ Kansas St

Again, the Red Raiders are involved in the premiere matchup. Depending on how the prior weekend turned out, they may be badly in need of wins. The Mountaineers may be able to pass Tech in the standings. TCU may be able to put WV and Tech in the rear view, or may be fighting to keep up with the other teams.

The bottom line is the next two weekends likely will determine the frontrunner in the conference. It also could muddle things up so that it will come down to the very last game of the season. Either way, fans should buckle up. It’s going to be an entertaining couple of weeks.
