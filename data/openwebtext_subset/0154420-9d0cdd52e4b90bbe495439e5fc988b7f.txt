Josh and Anna Duggar (Facebook)

Josh Duggar, an anti-LGBT activist and oldest son of the reality TV show clan, owes nearly $14,000 in back taxes to Arkansas, according to a report.

Court records show the 27-year-old Duggar and his 26-year-old wife, Anna, neglected to pay $13,654.84 in tax debt over a three-year period from 2009 to 2012, reported RadarOnline.

Duggar serves as executive director of FRC Action, legislative affiliate of the anti-LGBT Family Research Council â€“ which has been designated a hate group by the Southern Policy Law Center.

He frequently speaks out against LGBT and reproductive rights.

Duggar claimed earlier this week that the couple had paid off $3,746.20 they owed from 2012, after an earlier report about their tax debt.

But the Washington County Circuit Court clerk said the couple had not paid any of their tax debt dating back to 2009.
