BALTIMORE (WJZ)–The Humane Society of the United States is offering a reward of $5,000 for information leading to an arrest in the gruesome killing of a cat in Maryland.

On September 7, 2016, authorities say a cat was found burned to death in an apartment complex in Hollingsworth Manor in Elkton, Maryland.

Investigators believe it was severely tortured and then set on fire.

“It is absolutely horrific to imagine someone intentionally and viciously harming an innocent cat in this way,” said Emily Hovermale, The HSUS’ Maryland state director. “Whoever would commit such a crime is clearly a dangerous person, and we are hopeful that this reward will bring forward anyone with information about this heinous crime.”

Anyone with any information is asked to call the Cecil County Animal Services at 410-441-2040.
