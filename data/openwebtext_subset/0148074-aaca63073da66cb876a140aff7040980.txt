With this weekend’s box office, Avengers: Age of Ultron raced past Furious 7 to become the highest grossing movie of 2015 at the domestic box office.

Avengers: Age of Ultron brought in $38.8 million at the U.S. box office this weekend, bringing its domestic box office total to $372 million. In its seventh week of release, Furious 7 brought in an additional $3.6 million at the domestic box office, but it wasn’t enough to hold off the Avengers. Furious 7 is now in second place at the domestic box office with a total of $343.8 million.

Avengers: Age of Ultron has already topped the highest grossing movie released in 2014 at the domestic box office, which was American Sniper. Even though American Sniper took in the majority of its $349 million gross in 2015, it was technically released in 2014. However, Avengers: Age of Ultron will likely have a challenge catching the $623 million domestic gross of the first Avengers movie. The first Avengers moie led the domestic box office for its first three weekends of release, but Avengers: Age of Ultron fell to third in its third weekend of release.

But don’t feel bad for the Avengers sequel, because the film is doing strong at the international box office, so there’s a good chance it will beat the first Avengers at the worldwide box office.
