CHANDIGARH: Love doesn���t come easy in Jatland. It never did in the countryside, where honour takes precedence over feelings. Neither Ved Pal Mor, who was killed on Thursday, understood it nor scores of nameless others who died in the last decade.

Monitoring such cases for quite some time, Jagmati Sangwan, state president of All India Democratic Women Association (AIDWA), estimated that at least 100 boys or girls every year are being murdered or forced to commit suicide due to love affairs in the state.

Sharing his experience, D R Chaudhary, member of Haryana Administrative Reforms Commission, who had been investigating honour killings, said khap (caste) panchayats every year force death of at least a dozen couples or make them leave villages.

More worrying is silence of government and administration in most of such incidents. This was clear in the killing of Ved Pal Mor as the government could not save the life of the boy despite orders of the Punjab and Haryana Court. Instead of taking tough action against negligent cops, the state just found a scapegoat in the local SHO, who had been placed under suspension. Social activists did not even rule out connivance of some cops as in the Manoj and Babli murder case.

In a starling reve l at i o n , Haryanas DGP Rajiv Dalal, had in April admitted that a young couple Manoj and Babli were killed due to negligence of cops in 2007. Incidentally, the couple was killed after a panchayat termed them brother and sister on account of the same-���gotra��� marriage in Kaithal district. Ironically, like Ved Pal, the villagers killed the couple despite the fact that police protection was provided to them on the directions of a Kaithal court.

In Manoj-Babli case, both got married on May 18, 2007, the entire village turned against them and the panchayat ostracized Manoj���s family, decreeing that anyone violating the order will be fined Rs 25,000. Phone call details revealed that cops accompanying the couple were in regular contact with the accused, Gurdev Singh, which reasonably creates a doubt that these officials had given information about the movement of the couple to the accused, added the DGP.
