The Oakland Raiders will be traveling to East Rutherford, New Jersey to take on the New York Giants on Sunday in Week 10, but they will be without a number of key players for the match up. According to head coach Dennis Allen on Friday afternoon, starting running back Darren McFadden, first-round pick D.J. Hayden, safety Tyvon Branch, offensive tackle Tony Pashos, offensive tackle Matt McCants and wide receiver Juron Criner will all be staying in Oakland and have been ruled out for Sunday.

McFadden will be out of action thanks to aggravating the nagging hamstring injury that kept him out of action earlier in the season.

Without McFadden carrying the load against the Giants, the team will turn to back up Rashad Jennings to take over as the lead back.

As far as the offensive line depth goes with starting right tackle Tony Pashos out and the back up McCants out, the team will promote Jack Cornell from the practice squad to serve as depth. Steve Corkran of the Bay Area News Group passed along the news.

Menelik Watson will be starting in place of Pashos at right tackle.
