Chelsea’s Patrick Bamford is joining Burnley on a season-long loan. The striker endured a frustrating 12 months with Crystal Palace and Norwich City last season during which he made only two Premier League starts. He is now returning to the top flight with Burnley and will offer competition for places up front alongside Andre Gray and Sam Vokes.

The 22-year-old has been strongly linked with a number of Championship clubs, including Aston Villa, Queens Park Rangers and Fulham. Yet it is understood he was determined to have another crack at the Premier League and hopes to be given more opportunities under Sean Dyche to prove he can play at the highest level.

Bamford has a little under two years remaining on his Chelsea contract, having joined the club from Nottingham Forest in January 2012. He has yet to make a senior appearance for Chelsea, who have loaned him out to MK Dons, Derby, Middlesbrough, Palace, Norwich and now Burnley over the past four seasons.
