Announcement - 13 April 2017

We are sad to announce that our upside down tree has toppled over this morning at 4 a.m.

Never in our lives could we have imagined that this great giant that has stood sturdy all these years could break so tragically.

We are open, come and have a braai and a beer in front of the brave baobab.

Doug and Heather

Welcome to Baobab Tree Bar in Modjadjiskloof

"Come and see the largest Baobab in the world"

The Sunland ‘Big Baobab’ is in Modjadjiskloof in Limpopo Province, South Africa and is famous internationally for being the widest of its species in the world. Africa is symbolised by these magnificent trees. The Sunland Big Baobab is carbon dated to be well over 1 700 years old and has even made the front page of the Wall Street Journal!



When baobabs become a thousand years old, they begin to hollow inside. In the Big Baobab this has resulted in wonderful caverns and caves, where the world famous Baobab Tree Bar now amazes visitors.

The Big Baobab is on the mango farm Sunland, where day visitors are welcome. Sunland can also accommodate 20 overnight visitors in 5 chalets. We also offer quadbiking on our own quads or you can bring your own. There are hikes, waterfalls in the surrounding area and mountain biking trails, while the tree itself hosts a variety of activities. The Big Baobab has hosted many weddings over the years an there is now a honeymoon suite in a tree house for a wedding with a difference!

Sunland Farm is an ideal base for exploring the surrounding area - the Modjadjiskloof Cycad Forest, the Magoebaskloof hills and forest, the verdant area of Tzaneen and more.

Doug and Heather van Heerden bought the farm in 1989 and cleared half, planting mangoes and Palm trees. The Big Baobab is important both historically and ecologically and is home to many animals and birds, as well as providing food for many others. The van Heerdens fiercely protect the tree and the surroundings – woe betide anyone who doesn’t share their views!

Day visitors to the tree: R25.00 per person. Kids under 3 free!!
