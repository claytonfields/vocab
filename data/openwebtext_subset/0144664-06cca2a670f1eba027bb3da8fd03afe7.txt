Human beings have two sides to them, physical and psychological, and these have had two contrasting repercussions in business. The material needs of man have led to the great corporations of our age. The giant multinationals have arisen on the back of providing us with things we need to wear, to eat, to house ourselves, to call each other and to transport us to work. However, remarkably, the psychological dimensions of man, despite their importance, have had very little business impact. There are no multinational corporations that make it their task to guide us to the meaning of life, or to help us to be good and kind or to lead us through our rites of passage, from birth to death. Those who operate in the psychological space tend to be a motley crew, who work on their own and are suspicious of all organizations. The therapists, poets, artists and intellectuals of our time are cottage industries.
