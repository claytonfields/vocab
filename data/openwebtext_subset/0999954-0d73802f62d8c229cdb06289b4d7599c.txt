Well, that reality stands true even today. Kejriwal is still the leader of a city (which lusts for free bijli, paani, and wi-fi), and the recent revolts within AAP, and all that dirty linen being washed out openly in public by AAP, shows his sheer inability to take everyone together. That is precisely why Shanti Bhushan said that he lacks organizational ability and should not be a Chief Minister. His prophecy is becoming true within the very forst month. Just ten days after Kejriwal boastfully sermonized to others that AAP workers should not have 'ahankaar' (while at the same time branding BJP and Congress as 'ahankaari' parties), it comes out that the most 'ahankaari' guy in AAP is he himself as he cannot tolerate any other founder member in AAP attaining some status within the party. When AAP's own pet 'Lokpal' pointed out the one-man-one-post rule being violated by Kejriwal, and objected to his holding dual posts, he was brushed aside by Kejriwal and his coterie. What does this show? It only shows that all that talk of Jan Lokpal by Kejriwal and his coterie was a plain bluff to milk Anna Hazare's ideals to gain power in Delhi. Can someone who brazenly insults own party Lokpal ever be trusted to work towards a national Jan Lokpal?
