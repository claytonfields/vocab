This past weekend the Midtown Chiropractic Open was held at a few courses in our area, Raleigh, NC, and I went out for round 3 on Sunday to watch some of the Pros Play. Guys like Barry Schultz, Michael Johansen, Terry Gallops, and world record holding David Wiggins Jr.

I got a few good clips of the other pros as well that Iâ€™ll post later but I wanted to get this shot of David Wiggins Jr throwing #9 at Middle Creek. The hole measures about ~330 but with the basket up on the hill it plays a good bit longer. Wiggins Jr. parked it with a Roc I believe.

He plays fast so I was just able to get the shot and then slowed it down for you. The first thing I noticed was absolutely no OAT on the disc. It rips out clean and smooth right from his hand.
