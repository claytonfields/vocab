“If no water flows to Rajasthan, the question of treating it will not arise” Dal Khalsa to Punjab Govt

February 6, 2017 | By Sikh Siyasat Bureau

Chandigarh: The pro freedom Sikh group Dal Khalsa today has urged the Punjab government to fend-off the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and take up measures to implement the resolution of the Punjab Vidhan Sabha adopted on Nov 16 last year seeking charges (royalty) for state’s river waters from non-riparian states.

The party president Harpal Singh Cheema reportedly wrote a letter to Chief Secretary to protest against the current order of the NGT directing the Punjab government to file an affidavit on Feb 8 regarding the quality of water being supplied to Rajasthan through the Indira Gandhi Canal.

In a letter e-mailed to Chief Secretary and Secretary of Science Technology and Environment, Harpal Cheema reportedly pointed out that Rajasthan seem to have forgotten the saying “Beggars cannot be choosers.” As per Riparian rights of Punjab, water has been illegally flowing to Rajasthan and now through one of its residents, it has the temerity to demand clean water.

While referring to the resolution passed in the state Assembly on Nov 16, demanding charges for river waters flowing to the non-riparian states over the decades, Harpal Singh Cheema further said that under the present circumstances, rather than the quality of water, it is the flow to Rajasthan that is the basic issue. “If no water flows to Rajasthan, the question of treating it will not arise”.

He is of the view that till the subject of enforced flow of water to Rajasthan and other areas was settled, the NGT or any other executive or appellate authority at the central or state level has no power to intervene.

Does anyone in Rajasthan realize the damage that has been done to the crop produce, waters, fertility of land and ground water of Punjab because of the continuous flow of water to Rajasthan, Haryana and Delhi, he questioned.
