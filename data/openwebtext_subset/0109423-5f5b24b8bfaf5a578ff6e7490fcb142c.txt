Shay Given is a doubt for the FA Cup Final after picking up a groin injury in training.

The veteran Irish stopper was ruled out of today’s 1-0 defeat to Burnley and now faces an anxious wait ahead of the Wembley clash with Arsenal on Saturday.

Boss Tim Sherwood opted to play Jed Steer ahead of Brad Guzan to see what the young stopper was made of.

However he confirmed Guzan will start in the national stadium showpiece if Given doesn’t make it.

“Brad will play (in the final if Given misses out)” he said.

“I have no idea what his chances are right now. We are assessing him each day. We are not ruling him out yet.

As for Steer’s chances in the final, Sherwood added:

“You wouldn’t want to throw Jed in, he’s not got a lot of experience in cup finals.

“The injury to Shay gave us an opportunity to look at Jed.

“If Shay wasn’t to make it and Brad was to get injured we would have a problem.”
