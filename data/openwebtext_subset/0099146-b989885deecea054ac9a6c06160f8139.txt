Honestly, people, why wait to fall asleep with your shoes on when you can just draw dicks on your own face, am I right?

Asia Brautigam, 19, as she was poking fun at our obsession with beauty bloggers, experimented with some eyeliner, and well? It’s dick liner. Cat eyes are out. Dick eyes are in.

Wow MUA Twitter has been so creative with their eye looks, thought I'd have my take ⛽️ pic.twitter.com/Nsfm460HVV — asia (@asialbx) November 18, 2016

And a bunch of people began following her lead.

Asia got ahead of the curve and told Buzzfeed she wasn’t trying to shade makeup artists just in case people started saying she was “makeup shaming.” She assured “I think they’re all creative and amazingly talented!” she said, and added, “My dick-liner will never compare!” There ya have it, folks..
