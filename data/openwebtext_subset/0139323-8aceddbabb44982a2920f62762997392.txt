Ever been curious about C++ and graphics programming, but not sure where to start?

Maybe you are an artist who'd like to build your own tools. Maybe you're a game developer wishing your games would run faster, or have even better graphics effects. Regardless, knowledge of the way graphics work at a low level is an empowering skill.

We'll be covering real-time graphics with C++/OpenGL as well as raytracing. It'll be aimed at beginners, but everyone is welcome.



This'll be an intimate workshop, meant for around 20 people. We'll give a talk and then walk you through some hands-on examples. Be sure to bring a laptop if you can!

Location:

Startup Hall, 1100 NE Campus Pkwy #200, Seattle, WA 98105

Come up to the second floor-- follow the signs that say "Startup Hall" to find it. We'll be easy to spot-- in the big conference room right by the lobby.
