Leonardo Bonucci admits Barcelona ‘excite him’ and ‘it’d be a big motivation to meet them again’ in the Champions League.

Having secured their place in Friday’s draw for the last-8, Bonucci was asked about which teams he’d like to face in the quarter-finals.

“I think it’s fair to say this reaching the last eight is the intermediate objective for a team like Juve,” Bonucci told Sky Sport Italia.

“We’ve reached the top eight in Europe, and now it’s up to us to improve again. What excites me most is Barcelona, they pulled off a great comeback and it’d be a big motivation to meet the team which beat us in the final two years ago.

“After the PSG game they’re the team in the best form. If I had to pick a team to avoid I’d say Bayern. They’re a complete team, with Ancelotti they’ve found a new way to play but they’re always winners.

“They’re a difficult team, anything can happen in a one-off game but across two it’s more complicated.”

Bonucci also touched on the arguement with Coach Max Allegri that saw him suspended for one game by the club.

“I think these kind of things can happen during the season.

“It helped the group, it served to cement the understanding between the squad, the Coach and the club even more.

“We must always maintain proper respect and our proper roles. I was wrong and I paid for it, the Coach was wrong and he paid for it. Forget it and move forward.

“It’s part of every relationship, whether that’s friendships, family, or work. I defy anyone to tell me that they haven’t had a fight with a friend, a wife, a colleague, a boss.

“It can happen, the important thing is to understand when you’re wrong.”
