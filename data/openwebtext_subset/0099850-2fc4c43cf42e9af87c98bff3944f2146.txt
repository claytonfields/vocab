Prepare to be merry: Brooklyn Nine-Nine has nabbed Jerry.

Jim O’Heir — who scored laughs as the loveable-yet-hapless Jerry (Terry/Larry) for seven seasons on Parks and Recreation — is guest-starring in the second episode of the police comedy’s fourth season. He will pop up as a cop who crosses paths with Jake (Andy Samberg) and Holt (Andre Braugher) while the two are hiding out in witness protection in Florida.

O’Heir is the second main cast member of Parks to appear on Brooklyn. Nick Offerman guest-starred as an ex-boyfriend of Holt last season. Brooklyn Nine-Nine co-creator Michael Schur also co-created Parks and Recreation.

O’Heir’s recent TV credits include Veep, Hot In Cleveland, Another Period, and The Bold and the Beautiful. He also starred in the indie comedic thriller Middle Man.

The second episode of Brooklyn‘s fourth season also features a guest spot by Ken Marino, who will play the precinct’s not-so-sharp replacement captain while Holt is in a witness protection program. The premiere episode, which airs Sept. 20 on Fox, also boasts a few celebrity guests, such as Maya Rudolph, Rhea Perlman, and Jorma Taccone.
