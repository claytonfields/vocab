On Thursday morning, Deion Sanders Jr., a sophomore wide receiver at SMU, tweeted this out to his nearly 65,000 followers:

Gotta get the hood doughnuts almost every morning. If my doughnuts don't come in a plain white box, I don't want them! — Deion Sanders Jr (@DeionSandersJr) April 2, 2015

His dad, NFL great Deion Sanders Sr., saw this tweet, and quickly came in to shame his son.

@DeionSandersJr you're a Huxtable with a million $ trust fund stop the hood stuff! Lololol. Son. #Truth — Deion Sanders (@DeionSanders) April 2, 2015

I’d say we should feel bad for Deion Jr. for being humiliated by his dad on social media, but he does have that trust fund, so we shouldn’t feel too bad.
