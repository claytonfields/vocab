Emoji pillows

The opinion about emojis tends to be split. Many people claim emojis are cancer, and 9gag community is strongly against them, but at the same time I see others buying all emoji-related.

So if you like them, check out the listing linked below; if you hate them, please accept my sincere apologies and check out the remaining pillows below (no emojis there, I promise).
