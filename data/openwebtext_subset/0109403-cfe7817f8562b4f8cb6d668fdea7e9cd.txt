Tiny Deadpool and Cable clown around on the Deadpool 2 set

As Deadpool 2 location filming continues in Vancouver, star Ryan Reynolds has taken to social media to post a bizarre behind-the-scenes set pic featuring Josh Brolin’s Cable and… Tiny Deadpool? Is it a young fan visiting the set? Is it some wacky turn of events where Wade Wilson becomes a child again? Check out the full photo in the gallery below and speculate!

Here’ are some of Reynolds’ quotes about the photo:

The camera really does add 10 pounds.

Josh Brolin and I love to just hang out and chat between takes. He calls me his lil’ Shake Weight™.

Quick timeout with my man, Cable. He’s amazing. Even though sometimes it feel like he doesn’t know I exist. But I’m drinking MILK. Which means I’ll grow up someday and pull all the blood out of his f*cking body.

Ryan Reynolds is reprising his role as the Merc with a Mouth alongside Zazie Beetz as the luck-manipulating mutant Domino and Josh Brolin as Cable, the time-traveling son of the X-Men’s Cyclops. Jack Kesy (The Strain, Baywatch) is attached to play the film’s central villain, which, while unconfirmed, is rumored to be Irish mutant Black Tom Cassidy. Japanese actress Shioli Kutsuna and Julian Dennison (Hunt for the Wilderpeople) have also joined the film in mystery roles.

Other stars returning from the first Deadpool include Leslie Uggams as Blind Al, Morena Baccarin as Vanessa, Brianna Hildebrand as Negasonic Teenage Warhead, and Stefan Kapicic as the voice of Colossus.

Deadpool 2 is set to debut in theaters on June 1, 2018.
