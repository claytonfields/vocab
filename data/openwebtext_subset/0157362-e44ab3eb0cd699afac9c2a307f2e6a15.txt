Back To The Future? Ok, we've got the laces. Now we need the flying cars... Favorited Favorite 0

We probably have all seen Back to the Future II and if you haven't, get thee to a Blockbuster (if you can still find one) or queue it up on Netflix. If you don't know about the movie, it takes place in the year 2015 and, naturally, it is a world full of flying cars and other futuristic gizmos that don't exist yet. Of course, we have 5 years to get our ducks in a line, so I'm sure it won't be a problem.



Blake's first prototype had the servo on the back. The new version is integrated into the heel.

Fortunately, there are people out there who are dedicated to making the gadgets of Back to the Future a reality. The first one - Power Laces! At the beginning of the movie, our protagonist Marty McFly (played by a young Michael J. Fox) puts on some futuristic Nike kicks which automatically lace up. He exclaims, "Power laces! Alright!" With no further ado, check out this awesome project from Blake Bevin.

Call me a bojo (that's the insult of the future), but I will definitely be rocking a pair of these if they ever hit the market. Read more about the shoes here (and feel free to make a contribution towards Blake's goal of having these on the market). Great work, Blake!
