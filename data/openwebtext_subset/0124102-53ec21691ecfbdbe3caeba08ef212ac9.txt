(THE COURIER-JOURNAL) -- A "Mex-Mex" restaurant that replaced Tumbleweed in Waterfront Park has closed after less than a year in business.

On Monday, Jaimie Schapker of Estes Public Relations confirmed that the Falls City Hospitality Group has ceased operations for Doc's Cantina, which specialized in traditional Mexican fare.

"Our goal is to always offer the best experience for our guests," the group's management said in an emailed statement. "We have not met our high standards in executing Doc's Cantina. Therefore, we have decided to close the restaurant, effective immediately."

The hospitality group, which also runs Doc Crow's Southern Smokehouse and Raw Bar, announced plans for Doc's Cantina in May 2015 and opened the restaurant in April this year.

Since then, the business has served customers to mixed reviews, with former CJ reviewer Nancy Miller giving the site a three-star rating while Yelp reviewers gave it an average two and a half.

Representatives from the Falls City group were not immediately available to comment on the closure, but the group's statement mentioned plans to reopen the space under a new concept.

"We are disappointed in our results, but excited about the opportunity," the statement said. "Our other restaurants in Louisville and Nashville will continue their successful operations during this process. We look forward to serving you again soon."
