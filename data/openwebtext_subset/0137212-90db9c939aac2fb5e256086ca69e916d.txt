The official website for the Arslan Senki: Fūjin Ranbu (The Heroic Legend of Arslan: Dust Storm Dance) television anime series revealed the character illustrations for Alfreed and Jaswant on Thursday. Manami Numakura and Wataru Hatano respectively are returning to voice the two characters.

The website revealed the character illustrations for Arslan, Daryun, Narsus, Elam, Gieve, and Falangies last month.

The second season will premiere in July. The new season will air on Sundays at 5 p.m. on MBS and TBS, which is the "Nichigo" timeslot.

The staff and cast are returning to the new series, but Kyō Yamashita is the new CG director, replacing Daisuke Suzuki, and Tatsuya Shimano is replacing Hiroshi Adachi as the modeling director. Felix Film is replacing SANZIGEN with the 3DCGI. Eir Aoi (Sword Art Online, Fate/Zero) will perform the new season's opening theme song and Kalafina (Madoka Magica, first season of The Heroic Legend of Arslan) will perform the ending theme song.
