When you have to present your concept design work to a client it really helps if you can give it a bit of added realism to help them imagine the final result. And that's where Product Mockups come in. These very cool files on GraphicRiver & Placeit will let you very quickly place your design work into a mockup of their final spot. Not only will you love them for presenting concept work, but next time you're making a web portfolio these gems will help your work really shine.

Graphic Design Week

To celebrate the launch of GraphicRiver's new Print Design Templates category we're putting on a whole week of graphic design tutorials on both Psdtuts+ and Vectortuts+. The new category means you can now sell your design work to make extra cash On the flip side if you're coming up short on inspiration, you can get a kickstart by grabbing a Photoshop, Illustrator or InDesign template via GraphicRiver. So to give the new category the launch it deserves, all this week we'll be bringing you articles and tutorials just like this one, on graphic design as part of our Tuts+ Graphic Design Week.
