We talked to Na`Vi's Ladislav 'GuardiaN' Kovács about his team's victory over Liquid as well as the upcoming grand final of ESL One New York.

Despite going down in the first map to Liquid, CIS region team Natus Vincere rallied and won the series and advance to the final of the $250,000 event, with players Egor "flamie" Vasilyev and Aleksandr "s1mple" Kostyliev having strong performances.

Afterwards, we caught up with Ladislav "GuardiaN" Kovács of the team to ask him a few questions about the Liquid match, the grand final, and the new update and pause rules that are in effect in New York.
