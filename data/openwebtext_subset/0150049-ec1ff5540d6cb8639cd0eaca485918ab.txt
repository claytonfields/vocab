A 29-year-old Palm Beach County woman has been charged with child neglect after authorities said she falsely reported her daughter had been kidnapped from a Greenacres market.

Maria Irias was booked into the Palm Beach County jail Sunday after admitting to detectives that she made up the story because she “had been drinking most of the day and she simply can’t remember where her daughter" was, according to the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office.

She last remembered seeing her six-year-old daughter “around 3:30 or 4:00 pm Saturday,” deputies said.

Irias has also been charged with making a false report of a crime, deputies said.

On Saturday Irias told deputies that she was with her daughter at El Bodegon, at Forest Hill Blvd and Jog Road, when she accepted a stranger’s offer of a ride home. Irias said that after arriving at her residence in the Tavaras Cove Mobile Home Park, near Greenacres, the driver sped off with the girl.

Authorities issued an Amber Alert on Saturday to ask for the public’s assistance in locating the girl.

Deputies said Irias was not at the store.

The child was located unharmed, deputies said.
