After 25 years of decidedly unawesome back and forth, the third Bill & Ted adventure has officially been confirmed. According to Alex ‘Bill’ Winter – who starred alongside Keanu Reeves in the original two movies – the film is now in pre-production, with a script, director, and studio all set to go.

“We've been working on it for, like six years,” he confirmed to Forbes this month. “We're knee-deep in the script, it's been written by Chris Matheson and Ed Solomon, who wrote the first two, they are fantastic writers, and the script is great... We're just trying to nail down a start date.”

Winter also stressed that Keanu was obviously on board, because, in his own words, “how the fuck would they make it if he wasn’t on board?”

“People always ask if Keanu’s doing it and I’m like, ‘No, I’m making a Bill movie’,” he joked. “Of course he’s in it. I can’t make a Bill & Ted movie without Keanu.”

The film is apparently set to start shooting at either the end of this year or the beginning of next – which means it may be a while before we actually see the finished result. In the meantime, you can console yourself with Keanu’s new book about (actual) shadows, which is apparently available to buy now.
