Rainbow, a girl group under DSP Media who houses KARA, A-JAX and others, is gearing up for a comeback after a long time hiatus of a year and seven months.

On January 21st, the agency revealed a picture of Rainbow’s Woori, Jisook, and Hyunyoung holding up a large drawing notepad with a beautifully drawn text reading, “Finally, Rainbow’s comeback.” Behind them, a photoshoot can be seen underway as well.

According to the agency, the seven-member girl group will be making their long awaited comeback this February.

They last released their first studio album Rainbow Syndrome, which was split into Part A and Part B released in February and June 2013 respectively. Since then, the members of Rainbow have been busy following their own solo schedules, branching out into other areas of entertainment such as MCing, drama acting, as a reporter, and more. In January 2014, the group partially returned as a sub-unit, Rainbow BLAXX, which consisted of Jaekyung, Woori, Seungah, and Hyunyoung.

Fans can expect a new concept and look not previously shown in past promotions and album from Rainbow this coming February.
