He says he has 'extreme myopia' and that he could not see the salute

Milo Yiannopoulos has been filmed singing a patriotic song at a Dallas Karaoke bar while he and American white nationalists were allegedly in the audience giving the Nazi salute.

The video, published by Buzzfeed News as a part of an investigation into Breitbart News’ ties to neo-Nazis and white nationalists, shows Mr Yiannopoulos singing “America, the Beautiful” at the One Nostalgia Tavern while crowd members give the salute.

Among those in the crowd giving the salute was Richard Spencer, a prominent white supremacist in the US who was seen in a previously disclosed tape giving the Nazi salute while praising Donald Trump after his election last year.

Mr Yiannopoulos — who developed notoriety as a right-wing provocateur at Breitbart before resigning amid outrage over comments in which he appeared to endorse paedophilia — claims that he was not able to see Mr Spencer and the others because he has “extreme myopia”, and says that he is not a racist.

The Buzzfeed News investigation stems from emails received by the organisation that show Mr Yiannopoulos playing a crucial role in mainstreaming white nationalist ideas through Breitbart. The emails revealed that he regularly emailed white nationalists, socialised with them, and asked them for advice. The emails also showed that he was in regular contact with neo-Nazis.
