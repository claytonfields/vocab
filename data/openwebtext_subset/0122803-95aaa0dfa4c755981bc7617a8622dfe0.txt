The newest Nuggets, guard Randy Foye and forward J.J. Hickson, met the Denver media for the first time Thursday at the Pepsi Center.

“We’re excited to welcome J.J. and Randy to Denver,” said team president Josh Kroenke. “Really excited to have these two new guys and they are another two outstanding players to add to the roster. Randy is a guy that I admired with his days in Utah (with the Jazz). We have firsthand knowledge of his shooting against us and the same thing with J.J. being up in Portland and also when he was back in Cleveland.”

Foye, a 3-point shooting specialist, was signed and traded to Denver from Utah. Hickson was signed outright using the Nuggets’ midlevel exception. The transactions became official Wednesday.

“I have been fortunate to have worked with Randy before and he brings a lot to the table both on and off of the court,” said Tim Connelly, the Nuggets’ executive vice president of basketball operations. “He’s an elite shooter, locker-room presence and is just an all-around professional.

“With J.J., it’s amazing to think that he is 24 with the peaks and valleys that he has seen so far in his career. It’s really hard to average a double-double. I’ve seen him develop into the player that he has become and we are fortunate to add him to our roster. The toughness and defensive rebounds is something that any team can benefit from. Very fortunate to have both of these guys.”

The Nuggets are negotiating to bring back center Timofey Mozgov. Meanwhile, the summer-league team, coached by assistant Melvin Hunt, who has been retained for Brian Shaw’s staff, is in Las Vegas and begins play this weekend.
