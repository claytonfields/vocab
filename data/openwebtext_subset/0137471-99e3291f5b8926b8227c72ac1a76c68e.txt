Last year, our Critical Role cast shared the songs that inspire their characters. A year has passed, and a lot has happened to our heroes. Vox’Machina wants to share brand new playlists that reflect on where they are today. First up is Vax’ildan with a few words from Liam himself. You can check out Vax’s playlist from last year here. Enjoy.

Liam O’Brien – Vax’ildan’s Playlist 2016

ALL MINE — Portishead

The Raven Queen flipped everything on its head.

GOING DOWN — Ani Difranco

Dragons destroying everything. Sister’s life dependent on an unintended bargain. Faith totally inverted. Love pushed further away. And hard times away from the table.

MISS MACBETH — Elvis Costello

There have been so many different opinions about the Raven Queen, both in Vox Machina, and the audience, I was reminded of this Costello song I’ve always loved. He was writing about an old woman in a town everyone thinks is a witch. The rumors and the reality all knotted together, impossible to be separated.

BREATHE ME — Sia

Showing up at her door. Looking for comfort, or reassurance. Bad to worse.

BIRD SET FREE — Sia

Born again, from the belly of the beast.

TEAR IN MY HEART — Twenty One Pilots

High five.

IT’S ONLY LIFE — The Shins

Vex.

Don’t Tread on Me — Kai Straw

After a month of scraping the bottom, Vax gets up.

Second Chances — Gregory Alan Isakov

Families can be complicated.

THE OTHERSIDE — The Roots

A new battle anthem for Vox Machina. Battered and bloody, and worn down from the road. But not done.

SONS & DAUGHTERS — The Decemberists

At night, when Vax lays his head down to rest, he has started to foster the barest hint of hope for tomorrow. He almost believes it.
