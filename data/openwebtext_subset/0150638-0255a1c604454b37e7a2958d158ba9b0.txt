Epsilon have decided to bench Owen "smooya" Butterfield, the British player has revealed on social media.

The announcement brings Epsilon's active roster down to just three players, after the Belgium-based organisation sold Fredrik "freddieb" Buö to GODSENT earlier this month.

Owen "smooya" Butterfield joined Epsilon and Endpoint in June, helping the European team to win the opening season of the Gfinity Elite Series.

The British player wrote on Twitter that he has been benched for not speaking Swedish. This week, several Swedish players, including David "Jayzwalkingz" Kempner, Kevin "kevzy" Nilsson and Gustav "ZINKEN" Björk, have joined Epsilon's roster on ESEA, but the organisation has so far remained silent on this matter.

Epsilon are expected to make an announcement shortly as they will be participating in WCA 2017 Main Qualifier, ESEA MDL Season 26 and Gfinity Elite Series Season 2.

With this move, here is how Epsilon's roster currently looks:
