The tension is high in the starry trailer for “When We Rise,” Gus Van Sant and Dustin Lance Black’s hotly-anticipated dramatization of the LGBTQ rights movement across several decades.

The eight-hour, seven-episode ABC miniseries stars Guy Pearce as activist Cleve Jones and Mary Louise Parker as women’s rights champion Roma Guy. Also featured in the cast are Whoopi Goldberg, Rosie O’Donnell, Denis O’Hare and David Hyde Pierce, among others.

“It’s been the honor of my life to research and craft these stories of family, diversity and equality over the past three years,” Black said. “To have collaborators of this caliber sign on to help bring these stories to life is a tremendous vote of confidence, and I hope a testament to the relevancy and necessity of our continued march toward justice for all.”

The trailer’s release on Monday couldn’t feel more timely in the wake of Donald Trump’s surprise ascension to the U.S. presidency, which has left the future of queer rights in question.
