Must-read (albeit short) cover story in Congressional Quarterly this week, on exactly how far the goalposts have been moved on executive power during the Bush years.

Executive power is such an abstract subject that it rarely, if ever, comes up during a presidential campaign. It’s hard to pose the questions in a way that matters to voters, although most of this year’s Republican candidates did get grilled, in an October debate in Michigan, about whether they would launch military strikes against Iran without consulting Congress. That prospect seemed real at the time, before the release of a new intelligence estimate that Iran had halted its nuclear weapons program four years ago.

Even when the subject of presidential power does come up, it can be easily dismissed because conventional wisdom holds that it’s nothing new for presidents to seek more power and resist congressional oversight. “From my experience, I don’t think any president walks into their job and starts thinking about how they can minimize their authority,” said Leon E. Panetta, who served eight terms as a California congressman before becoming budget director and then White House chief of staff under Bill Clinton.
