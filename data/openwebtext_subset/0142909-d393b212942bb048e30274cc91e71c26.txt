A 17-year-old Roseville boy was arrested Wednesday after witnesses saw him light a grass fire and run into a nearby apartment complex, police say.





Authorities responded to the fire, on the north side of South Cirby and Piedmont ways, around 8:30 p.m., according to a Roseville Police Department crime log. Firefighters were able to put out the fire within 10 minutes, and the 17-year-old was arrested soon after.



Police say he's suspected of setting only this fire, but think there may be a connection with other recent grass fires in Roseville, including the massive Maidu Park fire that burned 30 acres last month.



"[Police investigators are] continuing to investigate the possible connection between this incident, the Maidu Park fire and other recent suspicious grass fires in east Roseville," the crime log states. "Investigators believe there are other juveniles involved, and ask that anyone with any information about these arson fires give us a call."
