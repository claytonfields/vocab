Eighteen people were arrested in a crackdown on underage drinking in Albany, the state Department of Motor Vehicles said Tuesday.

The arrests occurred Friday, with the DM’s Division of Field Investigation working with Albany police to check for underage sales at bars and liquor stores.

The arrests for using fake ID to buy alcoholic beverages occurred at Sabatino’s Liquor Store on Quail Street, Washington Food Mart (part of an Exxon gas station) on Washington Avenue, and Varsity Lounge on Washington Avenue.

Investigators recovered 18 fake drivers’ licenses – one New York license not being used by its rightful owner, and 17 others from Connecticut, Illinois, New Jersey, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island.

The Lionheart Pub on Madison Avenue asked DMV investigators to train their staff on recognizing fraudulent IDs. No arrests were made there.
