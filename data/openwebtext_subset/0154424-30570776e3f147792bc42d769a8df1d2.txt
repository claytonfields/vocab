I’m old school.

I still have a turntable. I don’t have an MP3 player. Though I use a computer, I own a manual typewriter to remind myself of how journalists worked in the old days - before soundbites.

I came of age when Gil Scott-Heron, the Last Poets and Isaac Hayes showed people how to rap before it became a genre.

I like the best of the past, the richness of daily life and public discourse before we became obsessed with the constantly shifting culture of the moment. For me, old school is about the way things were and still should be.

But I’m not against change.

Some change is good: Like Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and Bill Richardson having a real chance to be the next President of the United States.

But blogging is a new school thing. So why is an old school black guy embracing this new communication form?

Simply because I want to use a different venue to get across a traditional message. Besides, I like the idea of using technology to cross generational, racial and gender lines.

There are things I want to point out that sometimes slip by those who haven’t lived as much or have different experiences.

Saying “life experience” is old school, like cheap concert tickets, the Cosby Show, red Kool-Aid and P.F. Flyers.

Paying hundreds of dollars for a music concert or a VIP spot in a club, watching MTV’s Real World, drinking Red Bull and wearing Air Force One sneakers are, oh-so new school.

New school is not necessarily cool, folks. And being old school is not old fashioned.

Sometimes, this blog will be personal and nostalgic. At other times, I hope it will make you smile and think. Sometimes, the topics will take on a serious nature, especially when race, politics, and culture play in the latest news.

I promise the blog will always be civil because civility is old school.

Old school is me.

Holler back.
