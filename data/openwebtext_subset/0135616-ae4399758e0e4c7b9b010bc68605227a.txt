And in California, the Los Angeles City Council unanimously approved a resolution Friday calling for an investigation into whether President Trump should be impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors. City Councilmember Bob Blumenfield authored the resolution, saying Trump appears to have violated the Constitution’s Emoluments Clause, which prohibits those holding federal office from accepting payments from foreign governments.

Councilmember Bob Blumenfield: “Constitutional scholars are raising the issue that if a foreign official or embassy hosts an event or stays at a hotel where the president’s name is branded from the top of the building to the chocolate on the pillows, it may violate this clause of the Constitution. The Trump Organization currently has business ventures in nations around the world, including Saudi Arabia, the Philippines, India, Argentina and Turkey. And because of his refusal to unveil his tax returns, or really any documents that explain with whom and where he does business, there are many dealings that we may never know about.”

Los Angeles joins three other California cities, Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Charlotte, Vermont, in calling for Trump’s possible impeachment.
