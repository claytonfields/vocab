Jon Huntsman, Sr., a wealthy industrialist and a Republican, is endorsing Rep. Jim Matheson (D-Utah) over Republican rising star Mia Love in Utah's 4th congressional district.

"The Matheson and Huntsman families have enjoyed three generations of respected association," Huntsman said in a statement released on Friday afternoon, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. "[Rep. Jim Matheson] is a conservative 'Blue Dog' congressional leader from Utah who represents our state very well."

Huntsman is the father of Jon Huntsman Jr., who previously served as Utah's governor and ran in the Republican presidential primary this election cycle.

Another Huntsman son, David, also endorsed Matheson, as did Abby Huntsman, who is the daughter of Jon Huntsman Jr. and works at HuffPost Live.

Although the Salt Lake Tribune notes that Huntsman Sr. is a "lifelong Republican," he has occasionally donated to Democrats in the past, including fellow Mormon Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.).

Love is one of the Republican Party's top prospects, and she is narrowly leading Matheson in the most recent poll.
