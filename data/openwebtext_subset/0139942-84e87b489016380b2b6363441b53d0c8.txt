Internet Raises $65k For Orphanage And Man Who Protected It During Machete Fight

And people think the internet is evil.. pshhh..

Meet Omari (above, obvs). His mother cares for 25 orphans at an orphanage in Kenya.

When a gang of thugs decided to creep on up to attack the place, Omari acted as their white knight, protecting them from the evils of the world.

Unfortunately, he got a boo boo in the fight. They sliced his face open with a machete. As you can see in the photo though, he is well on his way to recovery thanks to some awesome doctors with stitches.

Even more unfortunate is the fact that gang attacks are very common, and Omari feared it wouldn’t be his last.

So what does the internet do? It posts a pic of Omari and the story to ask for donations. If they can just build a strong enough wall around the land, they could live in peace.

They needed $2,000. They got $65,000.

Wow. We are in awe. It’s so wonderful knowing how compassionate the power of the internet can be.

Omari and the children will use the extra money for food and supplies. We think they might just be the richest orphanage in Kenya now,

Wouldn’t it be cool if they bought walls for other orphanages too??
