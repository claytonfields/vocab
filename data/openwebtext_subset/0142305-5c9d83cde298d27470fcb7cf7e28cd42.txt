We know Liverpool fans get everywhere.

There are plenty of weird and wonderful places we've seen LFC scarves and shirts paraded around the globe.

But one Liverpool fan has founded a way of supporting the club which may just about be unique.

It was spotted this week by bemused members of the Ordnance Survey (OS) flying unit as they conducted aerial photography in a remote part of the Shropshire hills, east of Ludlow.

The 196-megapixel cameras on-board the OS planes captured something they weren't expecting - a huge 'LFC' carved into scrub on north side of Titterstone Clee Hill (SO588787).

And it wasn't just a small effort.

Andrew Tyrell, OS’s remote sensing surveyor and air camera operator, noticed the ‘LFC’ , took a picture and sent it back to head office for analysis.



There Danny Hyam, one of OS’s CATs (consultancy and technical services team), measured the letters and they appear to be between 85 and 95 metres long - but may even be may be closer to 100m in length - similar to the Anfield pitch.

The letters are on common land and the OS believe they have been cut by a vehicle of some kind. Mr Tyrell has worked out that they can be seen from the southern end of Brown Clee Hill, some 6km away.

He said: “Perhaps there is someone living in this area who supports Everton and has a back garden or bedroom window with a view of the hill and has a Liverpool supporting friend with an extreme sense of humour

" It is one of the most unusual ways of showing support for a team I’ve ever seen.” Liverpool
