The director of the U.S. Census Bureau has resigned as the bureau ramps up work for its decennial tally.

The Commerce Department announced Tuesday that John Thompson will leave on June 30. The news reportedly surprised census experts, coming amid a funding crisis for the agency.

Thompson, who has led the bureau since 2013, had previously worked at the bureau for 27 years, between 1975 and 2002.

The bureau did not announce a successor for Thompson. A Commerce Department spokesperson said an acting director would be designated “in the coming days” and the position would be filled permanently “in due course," The Washington Post reported.

No explanation was given for Thompson's decision to leave. His five-year term ended in December, but he had been expected to stay on through at least the end of 2017.

The next census is expected to take place in 2020, and the agency has planned on using more electronics as a means of collecting data. However, only $1.47 billion was approved by Congress this April to be used for testing, hiring and publicity associated with the upcoming census. Experts say the budget is below what is needed.
