Melvin Carter, a former state director of early childhood education programs, has received a strong endorsement in the St. Paul mayor’s race from his boss, the governor of Minnesota.

The Carter campaign released a written statement Wednesday that included flattering words from Gov. Mark Dayton and Lt. Gov. Tina Smith.

“As the Director of my Children’s Cabinet, Melvin Carter has been a thoughtful, passionate, and effective leader, who has worked hard to give kids strong starts and better chances of success in school and life,” Dayton is quoted as saying.

“As a resident of St Paul, I know Melvin Carter will bring that same leadership to his work to make St. Paul a city that works for everyone,” the DFL governor said. “I look forward to calling him St. Paul’s next mayor.”

In July 2013, Carter stepped down from the St. Paul City Council midterm to oversee the governor’s early-education initiatives. He now coordinates the Children’s Cabinet, which brings together the commissioners of the departments of education, health and human services to focus on children’s issues across jurisdictions.

Carter has also been endorsed by U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison, St. Paul City Council President Russ Stark, the African American DFL Caucus and the DFL’s LGBTQ caucus, among others.

Among other prominent candidates in this fall’s race to succeed Mayor Chris Coleman, Pat Harris’ endorsements include former St. Paul Mayor George Latimer, the St. Paul Police Federation, the St. Paul firefighters union and the St. Paul Area Chamber of Commerce’s political action committee, among others.

Candidate Dai Thao’s endorsements include the Minnesota Nurses Association, the DFL Disability Caucus, TakeAction MN and AFSCME Local 8.

Candidate Elizabeth Dickinson has been endorsed by the North Star Chapter of the Sierra Club and the Green Party of Minnesota’s 4th Congressional District.
