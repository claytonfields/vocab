MSNBC Terrorism Analyst Evan Kohlmann declared, “You cannot have a situation where you take in immigrants and you do not integrate them” and that Belgium hasn’t learned the lesson Britain did, which is that letting jihadists live in their country is dangerous when they kicked out “all those people that they had allowed to live in London, that turned it into Londonistan” on Tuesday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “Hardball.”

Kohlmann said, “Belgian society, in particular, is very segregated. You cannot have a situation where you take in immigrants and you do not integrate them.”

Host Chris Matthews then wondered, “Well, why do they take them in if they have no intention of letting them become Belgian? What’s the purpose of that? Why don’t they just bar them at the door, instead of letting them come in with the purpose of ghettoizing them?”

Kohlmann responded, “This is a very important question that we should be asking the Belgians. I mean, you can’t do that, and then have no surveillance, or no oversight whatsoever. You’re asking for problems. And the truth is is that the Belgians have had an attitude, which not their own, the British had this for years as well, which is that, we’ll let jihadists live here, as long as they’re not targeting us. As long as they’re targeting other people, it’s not the end of the world. The British learned their lesson after 9/11, after the 2005 terror attacks, all those people that they had allowed to live in London, that turned it into Londonistan, they kicked all those people out. They arrested them. They extradited them. But the Belgians don’t seem to have had that realization.”
