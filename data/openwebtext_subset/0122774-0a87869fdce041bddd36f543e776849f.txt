The Cure co-founder and former drummer Laurence “Lol” Tolhurst has announced a new memoir, Cured: The Tale of Two Imaginary Boys. The book comes out October 11 on Da Capo Press. It tells the story of Tolhurst’s career with the Cure, which ran from the band’s 1976 formation until he left in 1989. According to a press release, Cured also “reveals the highs and lows of the lifelong friendship” between Tolhurst and frontman Robert Smith; they have known each other since they were both just 5 years old. See Tolhurst’s statement on the book, as well as its cover, designed by ex-Cure guitarist Pearl Thompson, below. Read an excerpt from Cured on Noisey.

This is a record of the things that have kept me awake at 4 a.m., the precious flowers of the past blooming in the dark corners of memory. I have tried my best to capture whatever that light shone on. I hope it illuminates events for you as much as it has for me.
