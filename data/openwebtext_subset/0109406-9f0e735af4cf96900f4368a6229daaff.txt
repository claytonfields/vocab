Air Traffic Control games are not new, as they first appeared on the iPhone, one of the first smartphones with a full touchscreen. The game rules are simple... There are certain runways on the map, and multiple types of planes (each of which can only land on certain runways). Usually, they are jets, small planes, and helicopters. Land as many of them as you can without them crashing into each other, by drawing them a route from where they are to runway's landing end. That's it, really. The original on the iPhone is by Firemint. Who has cloned the game since, and what other features have they introduced? We round up five of the current games available on Android OS and see who comes out on top.



REVIEW PLATFORM: Motorola Droid running Android OS 2.1-update1 or Android OS 2.2.
