A New Zealand family who believed their teenage daughter took her own life because of Facebook bullying have learned she posted the bullying comments herself.

The revelation was made at an inquest into the death last year of 17-year-old Micaela Emily Kimiora Pinkerton-Stothers.

A close friend of the teenager told coroner Wallace Bain in Rotorua today that he and Micaela had set up a Facebook page called Rumour Hate, on which Micaela wrote a post purporting to come from an anonymous source that she had been pregnant and had had an abortion.

Closely questioned, Raymond Gardiner remained adamant Micaela had written the words herself and was at a loss to explain why she had "cried and cried" about the message - as Micaela's grandmother told the coroner she had.

Netsafe operations manager Olivia Chisholm confirmed the posting had been made by the person, or people, who compiled the page.

Dr Bain reserved his decision, which he expected would be delivered no earlier than September.
