Yakuza boss in Fukuoka re-arrested in tax probe

FUKUOKA (TR) – Fukuoka Prefectural Police on Tuesday arrested an organized crime boss, already in custody for a number of violent crimes, on charges tax evasion, reports the Sankei Shimbun (June 16).

Police accused Satoru Nomura, the head of the Kudo-kai, which is based in Kitakyushu City, and three other gang members of concealing 220 million yen in taxable income over a four-year period ending in 2013. The boss is liable for a tax bill of 90 million yen.

The income was obtained through a process known as jonokin, which involves funneling money collected through the operations of lower members upward within the gang.

This is Nomura’s fourth arrest. Last October, police arrested Nomura, for involvement in the murder of a fishery cooperative president in Kitakyushu in 1998 and the stabbing of a nurse in Fukuoka’s Hakata Ward two years ago. He was also arrested in the stabbing of a dentist in May of last year.
