A gay couple living in Wynantskill, New York had their home and car struck by vandals this week.

John Mcenerney said his partner Lyle Houston woke up Thursday morning to discover the spray painted slur on the side of their home. The crude graffiti is difficult to read but “Jenner Fags” appears visible. A window pane in a side door and the window of Houston’s Jeep were also broken.

“You would think my initial gut reaction would be like, ‘oh my God, I fear for my life.,'” said Mcenerney in an interview with WNYT. “I kind of feel more sorry for the person that they felt it was necessary to try to destroy somebody’s house.”

WYNT adds:

Lyle said there was also an incident Monday night, but his pitbull scared away someone he now thinks was trying to break in. The couple says they aren’t scared, they’re just going to remain positive
