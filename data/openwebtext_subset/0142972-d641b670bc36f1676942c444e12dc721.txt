Police chief Mark Saunders has met with a family after two Toronto police officers were caught on dash camera video mocking their daughter.

29-year-old Francie Munoz was born with Down Syndrome.

The family says she was one of three women in a car that was pulled over last November, suspected of running a red light.

They decided to fight the ticket.

"After six months we received disclosure which included the video," Francie's mother, Pamela, told NEWSTALK 1010's Moore in the Morning. "Unbeknownst to the officers (the video) had audio describing our daughter in derogatory and demeaning and insulting terms."

The voices of two men can be heard in the video. One of them is heard using the word, "disfigured."

"My immediate response was enraged. I couldn't believe that officers would do this," Pamela says.

Chief Saunders visited the Munoz family home Monday afternoon to "connect" with them. Francie's father Carlos says the family is satisfied with the chief and an investigation underway.

The family is still waiting for an apology from the two officers.

Toronto police assocation president Mike McCormack says the officers are very concerned and apologetic about their comments, and that what they said does not reflect how they have been known to conduct themselves.
