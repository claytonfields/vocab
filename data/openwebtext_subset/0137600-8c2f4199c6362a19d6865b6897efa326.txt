New Cincinnati coach Tommy Tuberville is slated to make $2.2 million annually, making him one of the highest paid coaches in the Big East.

According to the term sheet negotiated between Tuberville and Cincinnati -- and obtained by the Cincinnati Enquirer -- the coach also will get an increase in his pool money to pay assistants, up to $2.1 million. Former coach Butch Jones was set to make $1.575 million in 2013, and had $1.85 million to pay assistants.

Tuberville made roughly the same $2.2 million salary this past season at Texas Tech.

"I think it’s market rate,” athletic director Whit Babcock told the Enquirer. "I think it’s good for UC to have a coach of his stature. You could make the argument that there are coaches without his pedigree making more than that."

According to the latest figures compiled by USA Today, along with new contracts for incoming coaches, Louisville coach Charlie Strong is the only coach scheduled to make more than Tuberville among those at public schools.
