adidas has already given the ZG version of the Pure Boost a makeover once before, removing its elastic midfoot strap and modifying its upper to create the comfy Pure Boost Raw. Now the Three Stripes is essentially combining the ZG and the Raw to create yet another Pure Boost silhouette: the upcoming ADO Pure Boost ZG. Debuting as a premium and limited-edition Consortium drop, the kicks take on the mesh construction, eyestay, and clean branding of the Raw and couple them with the ZG’s elastic strap and slightly higher cut while throwing a new external heel counter into the mix. Finally, the two silhouettes’ shared Boost midsole and rubber outsole make an appearance here as well.

Olive and black colorways of the ADO Pure Bosot ZG will hit Consortium spots like 43einhalb come October 14.
