Powersports equipment-maker Polaris has unveiled a production airless tire to be sold commercially in North America.

The company plans to begin selling its Non-Pneumatic Tire, reminiscent of Michelin’s Tweel concept, starting next year. The tire was developed by Resilient Technologies, a Wisconsin company Polaris acquired in 2012.

Similar to the Tweel, Polaris’ airless tire uses a durable, flexible mesh structure to carry the load of the vehicle and driver. It is considered ideal for military applications because the tires cannot suffer a puncture, and because the ride and responsiveness is said to be the same as a regular pneumatic tire, recreational users will appreciate the added convenience.

The “tread” of the tire can be developed and compounded for a wide range of applications, including off-roading, farm and utility or high-performance use.

Polaris said the tire initially will be available for ATVs, but the company is considering other applications, as well.
