Chen was caught on surveillance video abusing the animals.

The Philadelphia man caught on surveillance camera juggling kittens inside a Logan Chinese restaurant pleaded guilty to cruelty to four counts of animal cruelty.

YuZhen Chen, 26, received two years of probation, according to court records.

Chen was arrested in July after Philadelphia Police saw video that showed him throwing kittens in the air, rolling them on the ground, and swinging them in circles.

Police investigating a shooting at the Red Star Chinese take-out restaurant say they found video of Chen, who owned the restaurant at the time, abusing the cats. Cops then contacted the SPCA.

"This is not neglect. It's malicious and he was intending on purposely hurting and torturing these kittens it's very disturbing," said Richard Loos, PSPCA.

Investigators say they were only able to rescue the mother cat and two of her kittens.

Besides probation, Chen must also pay about $44 a month in penalties, according to court records.
