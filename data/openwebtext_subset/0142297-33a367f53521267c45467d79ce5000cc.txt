After getting a good night of sleep I'm ready for some late games this weekend; Apparently so are the Astros:

1st Inning

Justin Maxwell gets the scoring started with a double that he tried to stretch into a triple. Replay's showed that Maxwell could have been called safe at third even though he was beaten by the throw (sorry didn't get a recording of the play at third).

Jason Castro followed Maxwell with a double and Chris Carter followed Castro with a walk. After a passed ball Rick Ankiel singled to left to score both runners giving the Astros a 3-0 lead.

In the bottom of the first inning after a runner reached, a double play and a Albert Pujols walk, Bud Norris struck out Josh Hamilton to end the inning.

Here's Hamilton's jig after the strikeout.







Also on twitter BustaPozee gives us this wonderful image of a new children's program.

2nd Inning

Justin Maxwell hit's a bomb to left-center field

3rd Inning

With runners on first and third Ankiel drives in another run with this double to right-center field.





4th Inning

Marwin Gonzalez makes a nice play on a hard hit ball by Albert Pujols.

8th Inning

This kind of describes the late innings. Check out the couple over Matt Dominguez's left shoulder





Of course shortly after that Brendan Harris made this play





Then Matt Dominguez made this play in the bottom of the 8th inning
