The estate of Christopher Wallace (Notorious B.I.G.) have apparently struck a deal with a large marketing company which allows them to create products with Christopher’s name and likeness. Although there isn’t any information on who was involved in the decision, it is reported that trustees for the estate include Biggie’s former wife, Faith Evans, and his mother, Voletta Wallace.

Brand Sense Partners, the company names in the report, boasts relationships with past and present celebrities such as Chuck Norris, Brittney Spears, Jimi Hendrix and Halle Berry. The explain their relationship with these “brands”, by saying that they have the, “ability to consistently identify and unlock hidden value, allowing clients to maximize brand equity and growth.”

Undercover.fm reports that the line of Biggie products will be managed by Teresa Brown, who currently manages products from Albert Einstein and Steve McQueen.

Wayne Barrow, who formerly served as Notorious B.I.G.’s manager and now works as an advisor to Voletta Wallace is quoted as saying, “The family and I are excited to move forward with the exceptional team at [Brand Sense Partners]. Their understanding of Christopher’s cultural impact, as well as their vision for our brand mission made them the best partner possible for the task. We look forward to working hand in hand with them to build on Christopher’s unique legacy.”

It’s unclear at this time when and what products should be expected to come from the deal.
