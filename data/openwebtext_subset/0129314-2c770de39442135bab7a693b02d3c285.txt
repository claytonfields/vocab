Only Built 4 Cuban Linx is the darling album of bearded cratediggers and bright-eyed youngsters alike, and widely considered one of the best conceptual hip-hop albums ever created. First released back in 1995, the album made its 20th birthday at the beginning of this month. As we know, sneaker culture and hip-hop are intimately intertwined, and as such, it only makes sense to commemorate a classic album with an equitably timeless silhouette. Here Packer Shoes brings Diadora and Raekwon together to create a special iteration of the N.9000, outfitted in a rich royal purple suede for the “Purple Tape” release.

As the name infers, the colorway refers to the original album cassette, which was done in purple to distinguish itself from other rap releases. From the co-branded tongue that nods to the “Parental Advisory” tag to the track listing on the footbed, to the “Side 1” and “Side 2” embroidery on the back heel, the “Purple Tape” might be one of the most detailed album-inspired sneakers released to date. Crafted in Italy, pick up this special sneaker release beginning August 20 at a special event in New York City, and stay tuned to Packer Shoes for more details on a wider release.
