Store in the cellar Because all your site’s content and configuration is stored in simple text files, it fits nicely in a revision control system like Git or Mercurial. It’s not only more practical, but also safer!

Serve on the counter Although it can run a flat-file CMS , PieCrust is designed as a static website generator. This means it can “bake” your website into simple HTML files that you can publish with a minimum of resources on your server. A sudden spike of visitors can’t crash your MySQL database when you don’t need one!

Familiar ingredients PieCrust uses all the ingredients you already like, such as Markdown and Textile for formatting, or Jinja2 and Mustache for templating.

Fully functioning oven PieCrust comes out-of-the-box with an asset processing pipeline, capable of handling most of your files – Less/Sass processing, CSS and JS minification, concatenation, and more.

Super-fast service Because PieCrust is also designed as a lightweight (flat-file) CMS, it can render your pages in less than a few milliseconds in most cases. It means that previewing or generating your website is super fast!
