BOCA RATON, Fla. -- The Detroit Lions are still playing coy with what their alternate uniforms will look like next season, but president Rod Wood shed some more light on their roll out Tuesday. "They'll be rolled out, I think, once the schedule comes out -- which, hopefully, will be relatively soon," Wood said Tuesday during the NFL owners meetings at the Boca Raton Resort & Spa. "That's usually kind of late April. There'll be more clarity around the Thursday night schedule, and then I think the league will be prepared to kind of talk about the whole Color Rush idea for the whole NFL."

The Lions are about to wear their first alternate uniform since this Thanksgiving game against New England in 2010.

The league debuted the Color Rush uniforms last season, and will expand the program to include all teams playing on Thursday this year. Schedules have not been announced yet, so it's unclear whether the Lions have a Thursday night game or will be wearing the alternate look on Thanksgiving. This will mark the first time since the Thanksgiving game in 2010 that Detroit has worn an alternate uniform. They lost that game 45-24 against New England. Some players have already seen the look,

, who raved about it. Wood said he's seen the jerseys as well, though declined to offer any more clues. "I'm not tweeting about them," he said. "I am not talking about them." What color will they be? "That would be giving it away, wouldn't it?" he said with a smile.
