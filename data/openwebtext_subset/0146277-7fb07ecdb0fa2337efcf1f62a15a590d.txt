It’s real! Yes, ladies and gentleman, it is real. After all the rumors and speculation, Sony themselves have let the cat out the bag. Neogaf user fernoca has leaked a banner from the PSN store for a Last Of Us Remastered Version. The banner is straight to the point, and it kills all the rumors. Check it out below.

As you can see, the banner is self-explanatory. It’s official, it’s coming! It’s even available for pre-order. Here’s an even bigger image below if you don’t believe us.

And there it is. Unfortunately, the ad now leads to a “page not found” result like the image below.

This is expected since this is one of Sony‘s “biggest secrets”. Now that it is confirmed, when will Sony officially confirm this? Pax East? E3? Time is ticking. Of course we’ll keep you updated as the news rolls in. Stay tuned here at Junkie Monkeys for more gaming news and updates.
