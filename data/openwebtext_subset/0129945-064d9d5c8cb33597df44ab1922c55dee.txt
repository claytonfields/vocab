Come and play at the fifth annual West Asheville Garden Stroll, Saturday, September 14, 2013 from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., rain or shine! This year’s theme, “Play in the Garden”, will be highlighted during family-friendly kick-off ceremonies in Christopher Mello’s supremely whimsical garden, 307 Waynesville Avenue in West Asheville.

Whee Ahh Faerie Kin, a performance troupe of magical beings – “mythical, elemental, wild and free” – will inaugurate the 2013 stroll with heart-full songs, faerie mist and other delights at 10:30 a.m. Asheville-based Bee City USA will provide an educational exhibit on creating sustainable habitats for pollinators, and homemade bee homes for non-hiving bees will be on exhibit.

The 2013 Stroll includes approximately 15 gardens in West Asheville, with this year’s gardens centered along Westwood Place and Waynesville Avenue. Garden features along the way will include a variety of permaculture features, set-ups for chickens and bees, vegetable beds for sunny spots and other possibilities for shade, garden art and wild spaces. The route for the Stroll includes number of historic homes in West Asheville’s oldest residential neighborhood.

The West Asheville Garden Stroll is a non-profit endeavor led by a group of passionate gardeners. It is FREE and open to the public. Volunteer opportunities and additional information are available at www.WestAshevilleGardens.com.
