You know as a company that you've made it when your flagship smartphone product has been unforgivingly copied by a Chinese knock-off producer - something that has recently happened to Nokia, as a cheap knock-off of the Lumia 920 has been spotted in India. Unsurprisingly this device is not actually running Windows Phone (or Android), although it does run "normal embedded software" according to the eBay listing.

The knock-off, called the Lamia R920 (or the Lumia R9, or the Lamia R9, or the Lumia R920; they can't quite make up their mind), packs an impressive 4.5-inch display, a whopping 2-megapixel rear camera, a whole 200 kB of in-built memory plus an included 4 GB microSD card, and dual-SIM capabilities as one would expect from a knock-off such as this.

Don't worry though, as the features don't end there! You also get classic MP3 player functionality, enhanced of course by the 3.5mm headset to connect to "universal headset", and there's also the possibility that the internet will work, although the manufacturer (Mhorse) doesn't seem too confident. And let's not forget that it is a "High Class Expensive" phone, according to the seller, so feel confident showing off the "smooth finish" and "fantastic look" to your mates.

The rip-off Lumia 920 is going for Rs. 4,450.00 on eBay (around US$82), so pick one up if you're interested.
