Because there clearly aren't enough ways to show a mother’s love, parents of newborns are saving their infants’ umbilical cords and moulding them into timeless “keepsakes”.

The new social media trend captures both the gruesome and surprisingly less gruesome artworks created using afterbirth excrement.

SBS Life is sure to shield you from the less savoury images out there. But of course, if you’ve got a strong stomach, you’re more than welcome to check the more gory snaps of #umbilicalcordkeepsakes here on Instagram.

A fascination with afterbirth isn’t new. In recent years, eating a mother’s placenta was a popular health trend. Some claim placenta to be a high source of protein, have key nutrients for mothers, and could even deter post-partum depression. The trend even saw dried placenta powder being sold as supplement pills.

This time round, no one’s eating it. Instead, parents mould the fresh umbilical cord into their desired shape, before baking it at low heat in the oven to set dry.

Though heart shapes and the word “Love” appear to be the most popular creations, many parents have really gone all out, channelling their creativity to make some rather innovative art pieces.
