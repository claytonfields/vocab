A woman is expected to step forward and tell her story about her experiences with Bill Clinton in Arkansas Kathleen Willey announced on her Facebook page Sunday night.

The woman was an Arkansas TV reporter and is expected to tell radio host Aaron Klein her story Sunday night. This is a developing story.
