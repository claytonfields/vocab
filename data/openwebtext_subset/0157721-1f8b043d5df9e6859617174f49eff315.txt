Comedy actor admits that he is not sure big festival slot is right for 'The Office' character

Comedian Ricky Gervais has hinted that he could take David Brent to Glastonbury, but isn’t sure a big festival appearance is right for the character.

Gervais is to play two live shows in May as his well-loved character from The Office as part of a new TV show he is making, but he’s not sure that extending the run to the Worthy Farm event in June would make sense for Brent, a struggling wannabe popstar.

Speaking to The Radio Times, Gervais responds to rumours about him playing Glastonbury and says: “It could happen. It would be amazing for Ricky Gervais but I don’t know if I can justify David Brent playing Glastonbury because David Brent can’t become a real pop star. He can’t play venues outside the story.”

That’s not to say that Gervais isn’t bowled over by the success of ticket sales for the upcoming live gigs in Oxford and London. He admitted: “It’s a bit odd. He sells out venues faster than the Rolling Stones at the moment!”

Ricky Gervais will perform in character at Hammersmith Apollo and Oxford New Theatre next month.

Ricky Gervais will play:

Oxford New Theatre (May 14)

London Hammersmith Apollo (16)
