A little girl made a big splash in the New York art world this week.

Four year-old Aelita Andre, of Australia, opened her first solo exhibition at the Agora gallery in Chelsea, but she's already sold some of her paintings for more than $30,000 on the side, according to NBC News.

"I saw great colors, great movement, great composition and very playful, and I thought, 'This is fantastic,'" Agora gallery director Anglea Di Bello told NBC. "Who is this person? Only to find out, she's a child."

Di Bello even goes as far to tell The Telegraph that tiny Aelita's work is "abstract expressionism" and also "surrealist".

Aelita started painting before she was two years old. Michael Andre, the girl's father, said that at as early as nine-months, Aelita would crawl onto her parents' canvasses (both are artists) and begin to paint.

Aelita "often incorporates bark, twigs, childrenâ€™s toys, bird feathers, and other found objects into her paintings, lending depth and texture to the overall effect. " according to The Agora Gallery's website. (see photos of the paintings here). Three paintings have already been sold for $27,000.

The precocious painter seems to relish the spotlight and on a recent trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art with her family, amid works by Picasso and Monet, asked her parents "Where are my paintings?', according to NBC.

"The Prodigy of Color" will show at the Agora Gallery until the end of June.
