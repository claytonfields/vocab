An Egyptian prosecutor says prominent activist Ahmed Douma has been arrested and immediately referred to trial for allegedly insulting the country's president in comments he made on TV.

There are a myriad of complaints against journalists and TV personalities, including satirist Bassem Youssef, for insulting Islamist President Mohammed Morsi. At least two journalists faced trials while others are still questioned.

But Douma is the first activist to be quickly referred to trial while in custody.

Prosecutor Mohammed el-Taneekhi said Thursday that Douma's trial will begin on Sunday.

He was arrested Tuesday after a Muslim Brotherhood member complained that Douma called Morsi a "killer" and a "criminal," and blamed him for a violent security crackdown on protesters in the coastal city of Port Said that left 40 people dead.
