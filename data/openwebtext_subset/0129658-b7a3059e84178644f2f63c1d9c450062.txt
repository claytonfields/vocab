Polish police have received a complaint that Robert Lewandowski broke the law when he took a celebratory swig of champagne following his team’s win against Ireland.

The police are therefore forced to investigate the matter.

Striker Robert Lewandowski was celebrating Poland’s 2:1 win against Ireland on 11 October.

He drank from a Jeroboam bottle of G.H. Mumm while frolicking following the game.

The win saw Poland advance to the Euro 2016 games in France.

It is illegal to drink alcohol in public spaces in Poland.

“We have started investigations designed to clarify the circumstances of this incident and the possible classification of the act as an offence. Then [we will] take further steps in questioning witnesses,” said Joanna Węgrzyniak, Press Officer of the Police District Commander in Warsaw. (rg/rk)
