A Thornton man with nine DUI convictions in Colorado and at least three similar convictions in other states is “a classic example” of why Colorado needed a felony DUI charge in Colorado, said Dave Young, 17th Judicial District Attorney.

Eliazar Morales, 54, was sentenced Thursday to six years in prison for his ninth conviction for driving under the influence or driving while ability impaired in Colorado, according to a news release from the 17th Judicial District.

Adams County Judge Cindy Dang also imposed a $2,000 fine. Morales’ prison will serve three years of parole after he’s released from prison, the release said.

“This defendant has demonstrated over and over that he will not stop driving while intoxicated,” Young said. “His actions put people and other motorists in the community at risk. He now has nine convictions for drunk driving offenses in Colorado and more in other states. Mr. Morales’ record and actions provide a classic example of why we need the felony DUI charge in Colorado. With this sentence we know that this dangerous man will be off the streets for the next few years.”

Colorado’s felony DUI law took effect in August 2015.

Morales pleaded guilty to felony DUI in connection with his Oct. 29 arrest, when officers observed him making an erratic U-turn in front of oncoming traffic on Federal Boulevard at West 63rd Avenue in Westminster. Other vehicles had to brake to avoid a collision. Morales then made another U-turn into a shopping center. His blood alcohol content was 0.182, more than twice the legal limit. He was on probation for another DUI conviction at the time.

Morales has nine convictions in Colorado for DUI or DWAI and at least three convictions in other states. His first Colorado DUI arrest was on Sept. 8, 2002.
