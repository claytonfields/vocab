Marvel's The Defenders Netflix series continues to add to its cast lineup, with some familiar faces that we've seen before.

Fans of Daredevil and Jessica Jones should be happy to hear we have official confirmation that supporting characters Foggy, Hogarth and Malcolm are all coming back for The Defenders miniseries event!





Just for recap (for those who don't know): Foggy Nelson is Matt Murdock/Daredevil's best friend and former law partner. He split from Matt after losing the Punisher case in season 2, and was hired at Hogarth, Chao and Benowitz.

Jeri Hogarth is a the high-powered attorney who hired Jessica Jones for detective work. After playing a dangerous game with Kilgrave, Jeri was violently mutilated. She recovered and helped mount Jessica Jones's defendse for killing Kilgrave. She then hired Foggy, and will also appear in Iron Fist.

Malcolm was Jessica Jones's neighbor, a junkie who was secretly under Kilgrave's influence. At the end of the season, he was starting work for Jessica's detective agency.
