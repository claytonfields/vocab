ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) - New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas says the state’s current electricity system is dysfunctional.

He took aim at utilities during a news conference Wednesday in Albuquerque, suggesting that the system is focused on representing the interests of wealthy corporations and special interests.

He says many families can’t afford to pay their bills and the system needs to be revamped to include affordable clean energy.

Balderas called on the state Public Regulation Commission to investigate the value of solar and wind generation. He also directed his own office to lead in the creation of a statewide strategic energy security plan.

The attorney general also criticized a proposal for dealing with the coal-fired San Juan Generating Station in northwestern New Mexico. He wants the parties to return to the table.
