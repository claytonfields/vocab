It's been a long day, battling with a raging cold + year-end accounting stuff, and was lucky enough to be stuck in a parking lot for 30 mins. because my building shares a plaza with both a Best Buy + a BJ's. Couldn't care less because my Secret Santa gift came!!!! AND IT'S AMAZING!!!! (You're all jealous of my haul, it's OK - I'll give you a moment to gaze in awe).

It's their first time, and they 100% knocked it out of the park. Santa - on behalf of all future giftees, PLEASE KEEP PARTICIPATING!!! =D

To start with, I'm venturing more and more into outdoorsy-stuff and am looking to challenge myself, so an emergency kit is def. something I need. I got an emergency blanket, water purification tablets, 15' paracord, jelly bean energy jelly beans, and a nifty pack to carry it in.

My Santa ALSO snooped through my wishlist and got me two DVDs I desperately wanted - The Revolution one especially as I'm 95% confident I'll recognize some people from my re-enactments. =)

Thanks Santa!!
