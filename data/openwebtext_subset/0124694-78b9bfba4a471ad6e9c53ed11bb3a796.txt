The Moscow mayor’s office has refused to authorize a protest against Russia’s new “anti-terrorism” laws, which, spearheaded by Duma deputy Yarovaya, give the authorities sweeping new rights to combat extremism and terrorism.

According to Aleksey Mayronov, the head of Moscow's security services, the permit request was rejected, because the applicants couldn't obtain the requred signatures.

One of the applicants, Leonid Volkov, believes that the rejection has no legal basis. The protests’ organizers are expected to come to a decision regarding further action in the near future.

The protest was supposed to occur next week, on July 26, on Slavyansky Square in Moscow in defense of information freedom enshrined in Articles 23 and 24 of Russia’s Constitution. Initially, the mayor’s office argued that the protests would lead to significant transport disruptions and suggested moving it to a more remote location. According to Volkov, the organizers agreed to compromise. The application was rejected, nevertheless.
