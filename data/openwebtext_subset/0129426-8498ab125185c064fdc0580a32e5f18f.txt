Pelosi first called for Sessions to resign late Wednesday, shortly after reports that Sessions spoke with Russia’s U.S. ambassador twice during last year’s campaign.

Sessions said during his January confirmation hearings that he "did not have communications with the Russians.”

Since the revelation, Sessions has faced rising calls from Republicans to recuse himself from any investigations into Russia’s connections to President Trump’s administration.
