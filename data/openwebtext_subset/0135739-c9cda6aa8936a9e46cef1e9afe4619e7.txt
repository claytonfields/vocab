never going back to older drives again, lightweight, FAST

Ok, as a test to see what this baby can do. I have an external SEAGATE 3Gb drive utilizing USB 3 for transfer - now this was fast. Was. I did two simultaneous data transfers to see what would be faster, what would take longer. Both of these transfers originated from the same local hard drive on my computer. The transfer data sample was 65Gb of miscellaneous files/videos/photos/documents/programs - totaling 1184 files. The Seagate drive expected the transfer to be complete in 1 hr 30 min. The ADATA drive (mounted internally) expected the transfer to be complete in 15 minutes. I am running Windows 10 Pro 64bit, with an i7-3820 liquid cooled, and 32GB Corsair Vengence DDR3 (1600MHz), with MSI GeForce GTX-970 w/4G RAM. The transfer speeds that I did were only downloading directly to the drive, not uploading, but from the speeds I attained, it was very nice. The speeds did fluctuate between 15MB/s and 60MB/s (depending upon the size of the file that was being transferred)... not the GB+ rating that the drive says it CAN do. I'd like to be able to tap into the complete speed of it for instant transfers. Most of the things I've transferred to it have been instant, but I wanted a intensive heavy test on it to verify it can do what you want. Anyhow, I recommend it. It works great for me!Read full review
