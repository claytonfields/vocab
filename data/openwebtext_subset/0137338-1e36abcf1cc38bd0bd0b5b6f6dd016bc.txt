Shipley, 24, was the Diamondbacks' first-round pick (15th-overall) in the 2013 draft. The right-hander is 8-5 with a 3.70 ERA in 19 starts this season. He has struck out 77 batters in 119 1/3 innings while walking just 22.

"He's really pitched well in Reno," Arizona manager Chip Hale told reporters, according to MLB.com. "When you talk to [Reno manager] Phil Nevin, there's been a couple ... farmhands have come through and really have controlled the offenses in Reno's ballpark, and Braden's one of those guys. We're excited about it."

Shipley was ranked No. 24 overall in ESPN Insider Keith Law's top 100 prospects entering the 2016 season.
