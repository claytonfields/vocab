Many fans have reportedly demanded refund after comedian Dave Chapelle delivered a 'slurred-speech' at his stand-up routine at The Fillmore theater in Detroit on Thursday, April 24.

According to TMZ, fans thought the 41-year-old comedian was drunk when he took to the stage an hour late for the 9:30 p.m. program.

Dave allegedly rambled while on stage, told a very few jokes and 'sat quietly' as he blew up on cigarettes before his crowd.

His rep confirmed the 'Half Baked' actor was 'definitely not his best set' and suffered with a show which was lost of ingredients. But that didn't stop many attendees from flooding the venue's Facebook page with requests for refunds, of which ticket costs are believed to range from $50 to $200.

An upset ticket holder commented on Facebook: ''Horrible don't go. Second show last night was ridiculous. Walked out. Did not get what I paid for..... refunds please!'' And another wrote: ''Can we get a refund lol was at the 2nd show and he was wasted lol crowd wouldn't shut the f*** up.''

Dave responded: ''Well, sir, it's a little late for that. Right now I've gotta get off the stage because it's 2 o'clock in the morning.'' But several viewers corrected the TV personality, responding: ''It's only 1 (a.m.).''

Meanwhile the Detriot News reports that the 'Undercover Brother' actor's earlier sold-out performance of the night was described as 'cool and calm' with 'sharp' material.

So, what then happened to Dave?
