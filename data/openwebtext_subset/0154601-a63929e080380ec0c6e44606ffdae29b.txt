Disney Infinity Farming Guide: Part 1 – Crops & Plants

Disney Infinity 3.0 introduced us to Toy Box Farming, a fun little mini game of sorts where you can grow and harvest crops in order to level and evolve your in game Sidekick companions.

Growing different crops can bring you different perks, as each individual crop benefits your Sidekick’s stats in different ways.

Everyone starts off growing nothing but weeds and flowers, but eventually with some patience you make your way into more and more useful crops, eventually growing up to 20 unique and interesting Disney creations.

The Perks

Crops each have unique perks which level the stats of your Sidekicks when consumed. While some crops only affect one specific perk, later crops can have multiple perk advantages.

Here are the five stats that each crop can ultimately help level up:

Attack

Heart

Energy

Tools

Luck

Each perk affects the ability to equip Hats, Tools, & Weapons, with the higher and more advanced gear requiring much higher stats.

The Crops

There are over 20 different types of crops you can grow while playing around in the Disney Infinity Farming Toy Boxes.

Each crop has three stages, first as a little sapling, then as a baby plant that eventually grows into an adult plant that is ready for harvesting.

After you harvest the plant, a crop collectible will drop and can be gathered the same way you gather sparks.

You can speed up crop growth by equipping Sidekicks with Watering Cans and allowing them to tend to the plants.
