Moussa Sissoko hopes he has forced his way into France coach Didier Deschamps' thinking for the remainder of Euro 2016 after an energetic display in their 0-0 draw with Switzerland on Sunday.

Sissoko, 26, impressed in a reshaped midfield that also included Yohan Cabaye and the recalled Paul Pogba.

The Newcastle midfielder went close to creating a winning goal late in the second half, bringing the crowd to their feet with a box-to-box run down the right wing, only to see Dimitri Payet smash his cross against the bar.

Sissoko earned plaudits from the media and his manager after the game and, with France progressing as Group A winners, he hopes to feature more in the knockout stages.

Moussa Sissoko impressed for France in the goalless draw with Switzerland on Sunday.

"I'm happy with my performance, but I could have done better like everyone else," Sissoko told Le Parisien.

"I'm very proud to have started this match and I hope that I'll have the chance between now and the end of the competition to be in the starting XI again.

"If that's not the case, I'll give my best to bring something extra to the team."

Meanwhile, ex-Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund manager Ottmar Hitzfeld has tipped Payet to help France go "very far" at Euro 2016.

Hitzfeld, 67, was Switzerland's coach when they lost 5-2 to France in the group stages of the last World Cup and thinks the host country will be difficult to beat again this year.

"With a player like Payet, they're capable of great things," Hitzfeld said. "For France, he's the most dangerous player. Every match he gets better, he grows in importance and he seems more sure of himself.

"When it comes to free kicks he's really incredible. He's going through an incredible trajectory at the moment and, if he maintains his form, France will go very far."
