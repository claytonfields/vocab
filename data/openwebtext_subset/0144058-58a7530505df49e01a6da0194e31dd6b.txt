Col. Qalandar Shah Qalandari is the most decorated pilot in the Afghan Air Force, recently he took command of a squadron of MD-530F armed helicopters. However, he is disappointed with the rotorcraft.

Speaking to a journalist, Qalandari complained that the American-made helicopter lacked the range to reach areas where the Taliban normally operate. The helicopter is not able to climb high above the mountain ranges that encircle Kabul during summer time when loaded with full fuel and weapons.

One of his pilots complained the FN M3P .50 Cal machine guns keep jamming. It also lack a gunsight.

But Lt. Col. James Abbott, a U.S. Air Force trainer for the MD-530F program, disagrees.

Criticisms are from pilots used to Russian equipment, he said.
