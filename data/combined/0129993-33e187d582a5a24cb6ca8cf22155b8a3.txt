Only 30 units of the LimaFLo Chicago Mk1 will be made, and we’re told these will all be made available via their Kickstarter only.

The goal for Chicago is a paltry £6,630 GBP, enough for 30 units to be made. And at time of writing and with 23 days remaining it’s already been funded by 20 backers to the tune of £5,016 GBP.

Basically for £221 you get an analog synth designed for house riffs and hooks and basslines. It’s not designed to compete wth the more illustrious Moog, Korg or Roland synths out there and doesn’t feature pitch bend, after touch, modulation, white noise, CV in/out. In this way Chicago has quite a limited feature-set, but we’re told its sound “portfolio” is large, has lots of adjustability and its own character.
