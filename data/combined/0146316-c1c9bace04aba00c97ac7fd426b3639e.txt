In a new call to “leaders of Buddhist Networks across America,” the North American Buddhist Alliance (NABA) is looking for those who wish to meet virtually, “possibly in support of one another and those who may wish to develop other regional Buddhist networks in the U.S. and Canada” in order to share “advice, resources, and recommendations.”

A first virtual meeting has been called for Tuesday evening, February 28, from 5 to 7 PM EST.

NABA describes itself as “a new, idealistic, and organic organization modeled after Northwest Dharma Association. We are not a governing body nor are we interested in developing a hierarchy of any sort. We are most interested in offering resources and information so Buddhists throughout North America may know about each other, collaborate as opportunities arise, and gather on occasion as a Sangha with a plethora of blossoms — in this still nascent Buddhist land.”
