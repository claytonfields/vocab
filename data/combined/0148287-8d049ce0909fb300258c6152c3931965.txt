At Planet Computers, we are passionate about typing, writing, being productive and creating on the go.

Since the introduction of touchscreen mobile phones and tablets, we felt that it is very difficult to type on these types of devices. On-screen keyboards often take up half the readable screen. We want to get back to typing on a fully tactile keyboard whilst being able to view the entire screen. All this on a device no larger than most modern mobile phones.

We decided to re-invent the palm-sized keyboard mobile device that will benefit many, who we think are missing using the keyboard on the move. From bloggers and creatives that need to constantly write, to professionals who need to read and write e-mail, create and edit documents and spreadsheets.
