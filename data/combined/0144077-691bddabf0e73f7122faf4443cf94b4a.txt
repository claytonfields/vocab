Today we launched an NPR extension for the Google Chrome web browser. Powered by the NPR API, the extension displays the latest headlines for various topics, allows users to set up custom news feeds and provides a streamlined listening experience.

For custom news feeds, you can set up tabs featuring headlines associated with a keyword. So if you are interested in news about Russia, for example, you can go to the extension options, enter the keyword 'Russia' and a new tab will be created listing headlines associated with this topic.

For stories that have audio, you can listen with a simple click. The audio continues to play as you browse through any web site. The audio player uses HTML5 to play the story. HTML5 audio tags allow one to play a clip directly from the browser without any additional audio streaming software, like Flash or Windows Media Player.

To try out the extension, you'll need the beta version of Google Chrome. After that is installed, go to the NPR extension page and install it.
