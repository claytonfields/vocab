The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department confirmed that an off-duty officer shot a dog that was attacking another dog in the 6900 block of North Campbell Road, near Deer Springs Way and Fort Apache Road.

The incident happened around 12:11 p.m.

A woman was walking a dog when she was approached by two dogs. One of the dogs started attacking the woman's dog. While this was happening, an off-duty officer was driving through the neighborhood.

"All I could see was the mutilation of my dog that I thought it was killing him ... then I thought I would be next," said Esther Pearson.

Police said the dog then was being aggressive toward the woman. The off-duty officer got out of the vehicle and fired the weapon at the dog, believing the woman was in danger, according to police.

"I think we're lucky that an off-duty police officer was here and able to assist a woman in need," said Officer Larry Hadfield with Las Vegas Metropolitan Police.

The dog shot has died.
