A little over a month ago, I was contacted by a PR firm representing this beer. They were having an event in Chicago to introduce the beer to the U.S., but I was on vacation and couldn’t attend. So, they sent me a few of these beers to try and review here on this blog. I also brought a couple to my homebrew club meeting for folks there to try and get feedback from them as well.

Location: Poured into a curved pint glass from the bottle at my home in Bloomington, IL.

Numbers: ~5% ABV, ~ 160 Calories

Appearance & Aroma: It’s brown in color with some reddish hues and very clear. There seems to be quite a bit of carbonation in it, leaving a thin creamy off-white colored head. It’s got a light malty caramel aroma.

Taste & Feel: The body is light and the mouthfeel is crisp. The crispness makes it difficult to taste anything up front, however, in the middle, a very light roasted caramel flavor emerges. In the clean, slightly dry finish, a light, slightly earthy bitterness balances out the light caramel maltiness. The caramel malt flavor and dry bitterness last for a minute or so in the aftertaste.

Food Pairing: This is a lightly flavored Mexican beer, so obviously it should go with Mexican food. In particular, the light caramel malts would pair nicely with slightly spicy foods, as the sweetness would balance out the spiciness a bit.

Overall Impression: I must admit, I was a bit skeptical, as other Mexican beers I’ve had haven’t been very flavorful. This one is an exception, and definitely has more flavor than other light Mexican lagers I’ve had. The caramel malts lend some character and flavor to this beer. When compared to Mexican beers, this one certainly has more flavor, but compared to other craft beers, it’s still pretty light flavored. Overall, I found it to be pretty drinkable and an above average Mexican beer.
