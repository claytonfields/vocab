A stoppage time equalizer ahead of plenty of fireworks capped-off the evening for Crew SC in front of the first sellout of the 2016 regular-season, with 20,389 supporters in attendance on Saturday, June 25.

After two League matches on the road, the Black & Gold return to MAPFRE Stadium on July 13 to host Toronto FC led by dominant forward Sebastian Giovinco as Crew SC looks to add to its seven-game unbeaten streak at home with a Trillium Cup clash against the Reds.



With large crowds expected on the horizon this summer, Crew SC is expanding capacity at MAPFRE Stadium for at least a trio of upcoming home matches, once more adding bleacher seating to the north end of the stadium.

The first of three Eastern Conference matches with additional seating kicks-off on July 16 when the Black & Gold host D.C. United for the first of two regular season meetings between the two clubs.

One week later, on July 23 , Crew SC hosts Orlando City as the Lions come to Columbus for the first time this season with Kak√° and 2015 MLS Rookie of the Year Cyle Larin.
