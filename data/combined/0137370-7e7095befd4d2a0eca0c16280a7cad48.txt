Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu has poked fun at a leaked US memo's description of him as "exceptionally dangerous," saying he sees only a smiling face in the mirror.

Speaking to reporters, Davutoglu also on Tuesday denied suggestions in other cables leaked by the internet whistle-blower WikiLeaks that his Islamist-rooted government is anti-Israeli with fantasies of reviving the Ottoman empire.

"Yes, I'm extremely dangerous for those who want to have instability in our region. I'm extremely dangerous for those who want to create new tensions," Davutoglu told a press roundtable in a Washington hotel.

"If somebody says to me 'extremely dangerous,' I look to mirror, I don't see any dangerous face. (I see) a smiling face," he said.

A high-ranking government adviser, quoted by US diplomats in a cable published by the German magazine Der Spiegel, describes Davutoglu as "exceptionally dangerous" and warns that he would use his Islamist influence on Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan.
