We have to start off by clarifying that this isn't an April's Fools joke- despite the timing and it feeling like one. On the eve of possible FCC review of their petition to the FCC for relief from small cell siting restrictions at the local level, Mobilitie is busted yet again trying to install 120' poles without following the proper local permitting and planning procedure. You can see the Post-Star story here. In the first situation, it appears Mobilitie told the fairground official for the fairground where the tower(s) were to be located that they were trying to drill "test holes" and that it was for "the utility company". Did their contractors just not know any better? Was Mobilitie just trying to get the structure standing before anyone would notice? Given this isn't the first time they appear to have tried to erect a pole without a permit, one has to wonder.

At a second location, the Post-Star reported that Mobilitie appears to have erroneously applied for a county highway work permit which is only applicable for temporary infringement of the county right of way. "Usually it's traffic cones for a driveway resurfacing, officials said." Mobilitie indicated in response to the article that it was following the correct procedures to get permission for the towers. One can see how this mistake may have been made- 2' temporary traffic cones are pretty similar to 120' steel poles with 3' wide bases. (Sorry for the snarkiness, the ridiculousness of this story assuming it is accurate calls for it.)
