Phonito Nano hidden earpiece

Phonito Nano by Phonak is the world’s smallest covert radio earpiece for undercover professionals.

With its tiny form factor, secure in-ear fit and skin-matching color options, Phonito Nano is entirely invisible to the naked eye, ensuring the user’s cover and boosting the chances of operational success.

Available in beige or dark brown, the Phonito Nano hidden earpiece is built around a new Hybrid audio chip and inductive technology. This approach offers users both excellent sound quality and allows Nano to be used alongside any existing inductive wiring loops a customer might own.
