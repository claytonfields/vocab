Undefeated lightweight Kurt Holobaugh (7-0 MMA, 0-0 SF) is expected to meet Pat Healy (28-16 MMA, 6-1 SF) at Strikeforce’s final event.

Sources close to the event today told MMAjunkie.com (www.mmajunkie.com) that verbal agreements are in place for the bout, though contracts have yet to be signed.

The fight serves on the Showtime Extreme-televised portion of “Strikeforce: Marquardt vs. Saffiedine,” which takes place Jan. 12 at Chesapeake Energy Center in Oklahoma City.

Main-card fights, including a welterweight title fight between champ Nate Marquardt and Tarec Saffiedine, air live on Showtime.

Strikeforce will cease operations following the event, and most of its marquee fighters are expected to be rolled into the UFC, which also is owned by Zuffa LLC.

Holobaugh most recently fought in June, when he submitted Ronnie Rogers at a regional event to secure his seventh pro victory. He has earned all but one of his wins by submission.

Healy was originally scheduled to meet lightweight champ Gilbert Melendez when the Jan. 12 event was dubbed “Strikeforce: Champions.” When Melendez withdrew due to lingering complications from a previously injured shoulder, he was then tapped to meet onetime title challenger Jorge Masvidal. When Masvidal was forced out of the fight with a back injury, and another possible replacement opponent, Conor Heun, was nixed, his prospects for a fight looked dim.

Holobaugh’s inclusion is undoubtedly welcome news, though both fighters have little time to prepare for each other.
