Chapter V: The Best in Me, pt. 1

Hey everyone, happy weekend!



While I clearly have to up my game if I want to generate Borba-tier discussion, I hope you’ll enjoy this week’s pages of our own abloobloo bun story. Just these two pages this week, they were pretty complex to draw.



I’ve also gone and made an official WutB imgur album for reading the entire series all in one place without having to go on sadpanda or mess around on freaking tumblr: http://imgur.com/a/RTBm0

Hey! You guys are aware that Water under the Burrows is the comic sequel to Water under the Bridge, but you don’t have to go read it because it’s now available as an audiobook!!

If you think sleep is a waste of time, and would like that I spend more hours everyday working on this little story then please do consider doing your part to keep me caffeinated by clicking this link!

EDIT: Fixed some broken links, thanks to those that pointed that out!
