Just months before the carbon tax is introduced, an auditor's report has found that more than one in six major polluters has made ''significant errors'' when reporting its greenhouse emissions and energy use to the government.

The report comes as the government suffered a blow to its clean energy efforts, saying it was rethinking its $300 million support for a massive solar power station that is struggling with financing.

Also yesterday, Opposition Leader Tony Abbott made clear on the opening day of Parliament he would continue his 2011 strategy of hammering the government over the carbon tax, due to take effect in July.

Yesterday's report by the Australian National Audit Office said that in 2009-10, three-quarters of major polluters' self-assessments - on which the government will depend for calculating how much carbon tax they owe - had errors and 17 per cent had ''significant errors''.
