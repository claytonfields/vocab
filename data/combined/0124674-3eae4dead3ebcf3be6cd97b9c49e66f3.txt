Pitch Perfect star Rebel Wilson says she usually stays far away from politics in her public comments, but she made an exception after Thursday's theater shooting in Lafayette, La., where a gunman killed two moviegoers and himself.

"I don't like getting political but America you really have to follow Australia's example re gun laws," she tweeted Friday.

Australia overhauled its gun rules in 1996 following the Port Arthur massacre, in which a gunman opened fire at a former prison colony-turned-tourist attraction in Tasmania, killing 35 people.

I don't remember a mass shooting in Australia since they overhauled the gun laws. It seems like every week in America there's a shooting. — Rebel Wilson (@RebelWilson) July 24, 2015

And as you can imagine, the response was not, um, terribly receptive. One responder told the actress to stick to being stupid in movies.

But Flight of the Conchords star and native New Zealander Jemaine Clement had her back:

@BAMBOOZER806@RebelWilson there hasn't been a similar incident since. Educate yourself before you call others stupid. — Jemaine Clement (@AJemaineClement) July 24, 2015
