Azerbaijan has rejected Russia's nominee for its new ambassador to Baku, further complicating the difficult ties between the two neighbors, EurasiaNet said in an article published on 30 November.

Russian President Vladimir Putin on November 27 recalled his ambassador to Azerbaijan, Vladimir Dorokhin, who has served in the post since 2009.

Citing their sources from the Russian Foreign Ministry, the Azerbaijani media reported that Russia nominated Giorgi Zuyev as Dorokhin's presumed successor in July. However, Baku has blocked Zuyev's appointment.

“It's not clear why Zuyev – currently the head of the MFA's human resources department – has been blocked. The government-connected news site haqqin.az reported, citing an official from the Russian Foreign Ministry, that it was because of Zuyev's "clearly expressed pro-Armenian position. Azerbaijani sources seem to generally agree that Baku is trying to send a message to Moscow by blocking Zuyev, though it's not clear what exactly that message may be,” EurasiaNet wrote.

The Azerbaijani media in their turn are trying to figure out the reason behind blocking Zuyev’s appointment.

“Many think that Zuyev is coming Baku with a special mission. With the presidential elections scheduled in Azerbaijan next year, he can play his role in that matter through Russia’s direct intervention. In his farewell letter, Dorokhin particularly noted that Russia and Azerbaijan have different political interests. It becomes clear from Dorokhin’s secret messages that the relations between Moscow and Baku are not flawless. Nevertheless, rejecting a nominee for the ambassador is a rare thing,” the Azerbaijani media wrote.
