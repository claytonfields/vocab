The Spotnicks are an instrumental rock group from Sweden. Formed in 1961, they were well-known for their “space suit” costumes and their Ventures-esque electric guitar sound. The Spotnicks have released 42 albums and sold over 18 million records. They still tour.







They would basically take a traditional folk song—think “My Bonie” or even “Havah Nagila”!—and then rock out on the electric guitar with space suits on.

I guess if your gimmick works, then stick with it! I mean, hey, look at Kraftwerk…







Below, The Spotnicks do their hit “Rocket Man,” based on a traditional Russian folk song, in 1962:





A killer romp through “Orange Blossom Special”:





“Johnny Guitar”:





“The Spotnicks Theme”:





“Amapola”:





“The Spanish Gypsy Dance”:





“My Bonnie”:





And last but certainly not least, hear the Spotnicks cover Frank Zappa’s “Lump Gravy” in 1969!
