Liberal comedian Amy Schumer is the most dangerous celebrity to search for online, according to a new report from the Associated Press.

Intel Security announced that the actress and comic was atop its annual list, which lays out the likelihood of connecting to a site with a virus or malware.

A search for the "Trainwreck" and "Inside Amy Schumer" star carries over a 16 percent chance of connecting with a site that carries viruses or malware. Schumer was followed on Intel’s list by Justin Bieber, Carson Daly, Will Smith, Rihanna, and Miley Cyrus. Schumer wasn’t the only funny person to make the cut. Other comedians included Chris Hardwick (No. 7), Daniel Tosh (No. 8), Nikki Glaser (No. 15), Kevin Hart (No. 25), Mindy Kaling (No. 30), and Kristen Wig (No. 52). Intel used its own site ratings to compile the celebrity list.

Schumer is a vocal Hillary Clinton supporter who has pledged to leave the country if Donald Trump wins the presidency. She has called opponents of Clinton "uninformed."
