A group of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender students at Louisiana Tech University are protesting an award given to a "Duck Dynasty" star, Campus Reform reported.

Members of Prism, an LGBT student group, launched a social media protest of reality star Phil Robertson late last week after they learned he was to be honored by the school's alumni association during Saturday's commencement.

The "Duck Dynasty" star, who has made headlines last year over anti-gay remarks, was honored with the Tower Medallion, an award given by the university's alumni association to "recognize those exceptional individuals who have brought honor not only to themselves but to the University as well."

A spokeswoman for the Louisiana Tech University Alumni Center told Campus Reform that the decision to honor Robertson was made "months ago" and that the reality start "had achieved a top level distinction in his field. And this is what the award is for, purely and simply."

Upon learning of his honor, Prism started a social media campaign, #NoHonorInBigotry, in response.

The group of students objected not only to Robertson's selection for the award, but the fact that it was announced to students just one day before commencement.

"We wanted to make a statement displaying our disapproval of the honoring, and for several reasons, including the minimal time we were given to react, a social media campaign was the best way to do this. Faculty, staff, and students didn't have any time to give input since no one new until the day before," Hannah Ellsworth, the President of Prism, told KNOE News.

People across the state posted Facebook statuses and tweeted at Louisiana Tech using the hashtag #NoHonorInBigotry to send a message to the university.

The social media campaign was accompanied by a walk-out by several faculty members during the graduation ceremony. Robertson did not attend commencement, his wife and son accepted the award on his behalf.
