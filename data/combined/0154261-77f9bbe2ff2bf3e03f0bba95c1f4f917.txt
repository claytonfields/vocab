So close!

We are incredibly close to reaching our goal! At the time of writing, we’re at $196.000, and 97% funded! Things are definitely looking great, and we’re humbled by all your support. Thanks so much for sharing the word and helping us reach our goal!

Now it’s our turn to deliver.

Free playable Alpha of Among the Sleep!

We’ll start by releasing a free playable build of Among the Sleep! Now all of you will be able to try it out for yourself.

For those of you on tiers $100 and up, your alpha access this summer will both include a bigger part of the game, and be more polished. In addition, your tiers will include Beta-access when it’s time for that.

Please do keep in mind that this is an early alpha, and does not represent the final quality of the game. After playing, you are also encouraged to provide all your feedback on this page! Also, if you’d like to share a playthrough on Youtube or anything, you’re free to do so.

Regarding Oculus Rift support, we’re working hard to publish this as well! First we’ll publish a stereoscopic video, so that you can experience the sense of scale and depth as fast as possible. We also want to publish the same public alpha we published today, with the test-implementation of Oculus Rift, but this will take us some more time.

We hope you have fun playing :)
