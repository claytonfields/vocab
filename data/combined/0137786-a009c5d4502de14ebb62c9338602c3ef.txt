The American Meteor Society has received numerous (355 so far) reports of a major fireball event over the Pacific Northwest and southwestern Canada on October 30th just before 6:00am PDT (7:00 MDT). The fireball was seen primarily from the Portland, Oregon area but there are also many witnesses from Washington, British Columbia, Alberta, Idaho, and Montana.

A preliminary trajectory plot shows the meteor entered over the southeastern Washington and ended near the Pacific coast west of the Seattle-Tacoma area. We have received very few reports from near the flight path, most likely due to cloud cover at the time of the event. The most notable feature of this object was the long path in the sky and duration of this event.

Robert Lunsford Bob has been interested in the stars as far back as he can recall His first experience with meteors was a biggie, the 1966 Leonid shower. In 1980, a major awaking occurred. He received a sample copy of Meteor News. He was amazed to learn there was a group actually devoted strictly to meteor observing! He joined the group also started to view some of the minor showers list among the pages of Meteor News. Lastly, he was contracted by Springer Publishing in 2007 to write a book on observing meteors. The book is now available and hopefully will be a useful guide to all interested in the enjoyable field of meteor observing.
