Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) announced on Tuesday that a federal investigation will be underway to see if any federal laws were broken by Planned Parenthood for its dealings with human fetal tissue.

This year, anti-abortion group Center for Medical Progress carried out an undercover sting of the abortion giant over its harvesting and donation of aborted baby parts. The videos exposed questionable business dealings that have led lawmakers to believe that the taxpayer-subsidized PP was profiting illegally off the sale of fetal tissue procured through abortions -- a claim the organization continues to deny.

Since the videos surfaced, PP no longer engages in such these donations.

According to The Washington Examiner, the probe is in response to a letter sent by Paul and 34 other senators back in October. The Department of Health and Human Services will conduct the investigation.

"Planned Parenthood selling body parts of the unborn demonstrates that the organization deserves not one penny more of our taxpayer dollars, and I am confident this investigation will give further proof of that," Sen. Paul said in a statement.

House Speaker Paul Ryan announced Tuesday that the defunding of Planned Parenthood will be first up on the docket when Congress returns from recess in January.
