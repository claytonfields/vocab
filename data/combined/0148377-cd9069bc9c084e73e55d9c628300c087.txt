A 25-year-old contestant on the French adaptation of hit reality show Survivor has died during filming in Cambodia.

Production of the 2013 season of the show, called Koh-Lanta, has since been cancelled. "It is not really a question," said a spokesman for Channel TF1, stating all the contestants have been flown back to France.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, the contestant, Gerald Babin, died on day one of filming following a tug-of-war segment.

He apparently complained of cramps in his arms during the segment and was attended by a medic on the scene. He was then flown to a nearby hospital but suffered a series of cardiac arrests during the transfer.

"Adventure Line Productions, TF1 and [host] Denis Broginart are devastated and join in the profound sadness of Gerald’s family,” the channel said in a statement.
