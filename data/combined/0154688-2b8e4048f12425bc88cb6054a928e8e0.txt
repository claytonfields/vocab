The latest weekly build of Project CARS has added a first version of the new lighting system to the title and our talented WMD community members have gone nuts with the new feature, creating boatloads of stunning screenshots.

The dynamic lighting system allows WMD members to experience the cars & tracks in Project CARS in bright daylight and during the pitch black night with everything in between.



All 34 screenshots show purely unedited in-game footage using the new lighting system and the built-in depth of field editors that results in stunning screenshots without adding any artifical post processing or filters.
