When the name of Everson Griffen was on the Vikings' list of inactives ninety minutes before kickoff on Sunday, it came as a huge surprise. After all, Griffen was not even listed on the team's final injury report that was released on Friday.

According to Pro Football Talk, apparently the NFL is going to take a closer look at the circumstances behind that deactivation.

The NFL requires any team who has a player with an injury or illness that could impact his ability to play after 4:00 p.m. ET on the Friday preceding a Sunday game to announce the injury to the local media (including the Associated Press) and the network televising the game. The information also must be given to the other team's P.R. director and the NFL. In this case, the Vikings complied with the policy only if Griffen became ill at the moment the team submitted its list of inactives. If he were ill at any point before 11:30 a.m. ET on Sunday, the Vikings had an obligation to alert the media, the Chiefs, and the league.

The National Football League requires teams to do this for a reason. . .*cough*betting lines*cough*. . .and while it seems like a minor rule, it's still a rule that's apparently enforced by the National Football League.

According to PFT, the Cleveland Browns did something similar a couple of weeks ago with cornerback Joe Haden. But, even in that case, Haden had been listed on the Browns' injury report. Yes, he was listed as "probable," but he was still listed.

We'll be keeping an eye on this situation as things develop. It's hard to imagine anything too harsh happening to the Vikings about this. But, since this is the National Football League, that could depend on any number of factors, up to and including what Roger Goodell has for lunch on any particular day.
