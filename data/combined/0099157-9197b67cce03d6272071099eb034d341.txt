​Thor, the classic God of Thunder in the Marvel comics, exploded onto the screen in 2011's "Thor".





The film did well, both with critics and financially, giving Marvel even more momentum to push its planed cinematic universe forward. Surprisingly though, Thor's debut film was a make or break moment for Marvel.





In a recent interview with the director of the film, Kenneth Branagh, discussed just how nervous the company was about the film.

Branagh had the following to say in the interview, as reported by ​Comicbook.com:





"Remember, there were only two pictures in the Marvel Universe. Iron Man, genius, the first one. [The Incredible] Hulk hadn’t worked as they’d hoped," he continued, "And then [ Thor was] number three, it was sink or swim before Captain America and then suddenly, oh, it was fine after that. We make Iron Man 2 and Avengers and everything’s tickety-boo."





"But everybody who was there knows that that was an incredibly sweaty time," he continued.





When asked if Thor failing would have hurt Marvel and the plan for their film timeline, Branagh had the following to said, "That’s certainly how they felt."





What a twist! Sounds like Thor succeeding was the best thing that could have happened for everyone!





Thor recently starred in the third film for the character, "Thor: Ragnarok", which has become a smash hit. Looks like everyone has this thunder god to thank for making sure we would continue to enjoy high quality superhero films produced by Marvel!
