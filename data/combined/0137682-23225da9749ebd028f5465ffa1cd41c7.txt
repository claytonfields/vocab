BHUBANESWAR: Expressing concern over the indifferent attitude of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) towards repair of Jagamohana of Jagannath Temple at Puri, Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik on Friday sought intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

In a letter, Naveen said an intervention scheme with stainless steel supporting frames to address problems of actual structure of the Jagamohana was submitted by Superintendent Archaeologist, Bhubaneswar for approval of the Director General, ASI.

The scheme was based on recommendation of the technical core committee, constituted by the ASI for overseeing conservation work of Jagamohana. “Unfortunately, the scheme was disapproved by the Director General, ASI with suggestion for further study,” Naveen said.

“We are highly concerned about such indifferent attitude of ASI as any further delay in addressing the problem may lead to a serious situation,” he said.

Stating that Director General, ASI should be instructed to reconsider the proposal and come up with a concrete solution, Naveen said the Odisha Government will bear the expenditure.

The Jagamohana is in alarming state due to severe distress/cracking of capitol stone layers atop the pillar head of four central columns supporting the pyramid roofing structure. Temporary supports have been provided to avoid any accident and devotees are not allowed to enter the Jagamohana, the CM said.
