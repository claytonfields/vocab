Author’s Note: I know many of you aren’t on the Sims forums, so I figure I’d share something here that I’d shared on my story thread yesterday.

It’s a few pictures of an “Alternate Universe Marklyne” — basically, what Mark and Jocelyne would look like as a couple if he was her age. And they are adorable. ❤ (Though it’s strange to see Mark so young!) Click the link if you’d like to see.

Now on with the drama 😛

———————

I knew this would happen. I knew it would.

Florian knows about Mark and I, and it’s not just in my head this time.

Clara told him.

And you think I’d be pissed… But I can’t really blame her, can I?

He confronted her about it last night, I guess… While I was over at Mark’s place. Florian told her he knew she and I were hiding something. And it sounds like he gave her some kind of big ultimatum. It’s not very surprising, I guess. Of course he’s sick of secrets, especially after what happened with him and Clara.

I get it. I really do. And I know he left Clara with no choice.

I just wish he hadn’t forced her to tell.

When I finally made it back to the apartment, they were still fighting about it. And once I was there, well, things just got uglier.

It sure would have been nice if Clara could have warned me. It was horrible.

I love Florian, but I couldn’t believe the things he was saying… “That’s so fucking creepy!” “What the hell are you doing?!” “Don’t you see how fucked-up this is?!”

And those were probably some of the nicer things he said.

How could he be so judgmental?! So close-minded?!

I shouldn’t have to explain my relationship to anybody, should I? I mean yeah. Hazel and Luc complicate things. There’s no denying that. But how dare he imply that Mark’s some kind of…I don’t know. Pervert, or something?!

God, I feel sick just writing that.

He didn’t use those exact words of course… But it was pretty damn clear what he thinks of this whole thing. And I’m really, really hoping it was just some kind of knee-jerk reaction or something. He’s gotta calm down eventually, doesn’t he? See how ridiculous he’s being?

I was SO mad at him. And so was Clara… I almost feel bad. Just when things are finally back to normal between them, this happens. And I guess it’s kind of my fault. Maybe more than ‘kind of’.

But no matter what, I was really grateful to have Clara on my side. I don’t know if I can pinpoint the exact moment she became one of my best friends, but last night definitely confirmed it.

And thankfully, she managed to convince Florian not to tell Luc and Hazel. Not yet, at least…

We don’t have a choice anymore, do we? We can’t put this off any longer. Not if we wanna be the ones to tell our families ourselves.

So it’s decided. Next weekend, I’m going home, and Mark’s coming too, to visit Luc and Hazel… And that’s when we’ll do it.

We’re going to tell them. All of them. Together.

And as much as I keep hoping and hoping they’ll take the news better than Florian did…

I just know it’s not gonna happen.
