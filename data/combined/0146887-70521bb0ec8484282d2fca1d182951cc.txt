SHENANDOAH, Texas - A 17-year-old man was killed by an off-duty deputy Tuesday night during the robbery of a Montgomery County fast food restaurant.

Investigators said Elijah Mark Cobb entered the Raising Cane's restaurant at 8:40 p.m. in the 1500 block of Research Forest Drive near The Woodlands with a handgun and tried to rob it as workers were closing for the night.

An employee at the restaurant, Bralin Henderson, said Cobb ran for the cash register and grabbed a manager. The off-duty deputy working security confronted Cobb, he said.



Henderson said Cobb refused to drop the gun.

According to the Montgomery County Sheriff's Department, Cobb pointed his gun at the deputy, and the deputy, shot Cobb several times. Cobb died at the scene.

The manager was grazed by a bullet, and another person was injured during the robbery, deputies said. They were transported to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.

Henderson said the deputy was working at the restaurant because of a series of thefts at other Raising Cane's locations.

After only two weeks on the job, Henderson, who is 16, will be quitting, his mother said.

The investigation is ongoing at this time.
