The offseason has begun for the Seattle Sounders and we're back to discuss the latest news coming out of the Annual Business Meetings. There's a new (sort of) majority owner, no change at the head coach position, along with several other tidbits that are worth of discussion. Jeremiah and Aaron spend some time discussing all the news and offering their thoughts.

There's also listener questions to be answered, so we did that too.
