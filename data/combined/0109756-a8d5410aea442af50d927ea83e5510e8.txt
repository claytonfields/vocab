Your eyes aren't deceiving you â€” if you spot a larger-than-life Rick trundling down a freeway in the next couple of months, it's real.

Wildly popular Adult Swim show Rick and Morty, has produced a Rick-shaped Rickmobile that's making its way across more than 40 locations in the U.S.

The Rickmobile is also a mobile store, and will carry merchandise for hungry fans.

It left Los Angeles on May 7, and its first stop is slated for Atlanta, Georgia on May 11. It'll end at the New York Comic Con on Oct. 8.

One guy couldn't believe what he was seeing.

There have been other sightings popping up on social media.

This time round though, it looks like it's Rick's turn to become a car instead.
