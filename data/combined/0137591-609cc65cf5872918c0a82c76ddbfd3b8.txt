Professor Proposes Letting Business Students Choose Grades to Reduce Stress

WATCH: Tucker Grills College Student on Removal of American Flags

Some students are claiming USC's longtime mascot, a white horse, is a racist symbol.

The horse is named Traveler, which was also the name of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee's horse. The name was called out recently by a leader of the USC Black Student Assembly at a rally following the Charlottesville riots.

The Los Angeles Times reported:

At the rally, according to the student newspaper the Daily Trojan, Saphia Jackson, co-director of the USC Black Student Assembly, asked students not to be quiet, and reminded that “white supremacy hits close to home” and referenced the name of the Trojans mascot. The Black Student Assembly did not respond to requests for comment, but questions about the name’s provenance have increased on social media in the midst of the national discussion on race.

At USC football games, the white horse is always ridden onto the field by a sword-carrying, Trojan warrior.

The university said in response that the horse "has always been a proud symbol of Troy" and that its name has nothing to do with Gen. Lee.

Bernie Goldberg reacted this morning, saying "parody is becoming reality" when it comes to outrage on the Left.

He said the story is "nothing compared" to ESPN, where adults, not students, decided to move Asian-American announcer Robert Lee off of a Virginia football broadcast due to his name.
