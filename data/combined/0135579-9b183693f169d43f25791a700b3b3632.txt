My new training partner #BackPack is going everywhere with me!!! Check out #TheMorningWoodShow to hear what I think about @demianmaia #MatchUp and #ufc211 recap LINK IN BIO @DinThomas Produced by: @tjdesantis A post shared by Tyron Woodley (@twooodley) on May 16, 2017 at 8:23pm PDT

Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) welterweight contender Demian Maia once pulled a Tyron Woodley. Now, he’s (finally) going to fight Tyron Woodley after promotion president Dana White awarded the Brazilian the next crack at the 170-pound.

Maia earned his chance to pull the sword from the proverbial stone by outlasting Jorge Masvidal at the UFC 211: “Miocic vs. Dos Santos 2” pay-per-view (PPV) event last Saturday night (May 17, 2017) inside American Airlines Center in Dallas, Texas (watch it).

The champ doesn’t sound too worried.

“I have the highest takedown defense in the entire welterweight division (and) second overall in the UFC,” Woodley told viewers during the UFC 211 post-fight show (via MMA Junkie). “Maia will have to pack a lunch if he thinks he’s going to jump on my back like that and take me down like he did Jorge Masvidal and Carlos Condit.”

When and where they collide has yet to be determined, so the aforementioned backpack may be in for a long and strenuous fight camp.

Stay tuned.
