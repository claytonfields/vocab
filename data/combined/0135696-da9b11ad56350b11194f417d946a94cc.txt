According to the official website DJI discontinued Phantom 3 Professional, Phantom 3 Advanced and Phantom 3 4K production. Basically, all Phantom 3 models except Standard have been discontinued. You can find this kind of notice if you follow the Phantom 3 Pro link:

Please note that the Phantom 3 Advanced/Professional/4K is no longer being produced. For the latest DJI technologies, please see the Mavic.

Why DJI Discontinued Phantom 3 Production?

There was a lot of pressure on the brand new DJI Mavic Pro orders that caused shipping delays, so they probably decided to free up some resources to manufacture new products.

Support Is Still There

We have messaged DJI support to find out whether they will support the Phantom 3 series products or no production would mean no more support? DJI ensured us that they still offer technical support and repair for the Phantom 3 Pro, Advanced and 4K and it would take about 2 weeks to have your drone repaired or replaced.

Phantom 3 Pro/Adv have been released in the March of 2015 and it’s been one of the most popular drones on a market for almost 2 years. Now it’s time to give the young a chance as DJI prioritizes Mavic Pro.
