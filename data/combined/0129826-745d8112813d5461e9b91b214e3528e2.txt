Mitt Romney on Wednesday said he wanted voters to get a chance to see Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson debate with Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.

"I hope voters get to see former GOP Governors Gary Johnson and Bill Weld on the debate stages this fall," tweeted Romney, the former Republican governor of Massachusetts and the 2012 Republican presidential nominee.

Weld, another former Massachusetts governor, is Johnson's running mate.

To earn an invitation to the first debate, Johnson, the former New Mexico governor, needs to score more than 15 percent on an average of five national polls the debate commission has picked as its criteria. The most recent surveys from the polls pegged Johnsonâ€™s average at 8.8 percent, down from 9.2 percent a week ago.

Romney has an openly hostile relationship with the current GOP nominee, having campaigned against Trump in the primary and calling him unfit for office. Trump has publicly ripped Romney and accused him of having "choked like a dog" in his 2012 loss to President Barack Obama.
