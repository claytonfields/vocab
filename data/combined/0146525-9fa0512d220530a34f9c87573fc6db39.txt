Yeah, I know I should be working on my commissions, but..I just needed a little moment of self validation.You see, I'm a very jealous artist. Haha I know I shouldn't, but I love comparing myself to others. A lot of the time, it makes me sad 'cause I don't think I'll ever be as good as another. I mean, I live by the mindset that 'Art is always a WIP'. I know it'll get better with time, but sometimes it just doesn't seem I'm not headed anywhere any time soon, in regards to skill. Sure, looking back a year I can see a lot of improvement! It's the future that's cloudy. Feels like my skills are stuck in a rut, and it's pretty hard getting them out and moving again.I think I'll just have to continue to experiment till I can find something I think will move me forward X) Or perhaps just stick with what I know and find ways to make it better. Or both!So here we have Garchomp, my favorite dragon type pokemon! I needed to prove to myself that I can draw scary things and jaws. The jaws are kinda off, I really hate showing both the insides of the top and the insides of the bottom like that.. But I think It's a valid perspective? I'll work on it.Heh. I'm my own worst critique :3S'it.Paint Tool Sai + Photoshop CS6 (effects)Full working size is as shownTook approx 30 minsArt by me, = Aevix Garchomp belongs to Nintendo.Don't use, steal, copy, trace, or otherwise kplzthx.
