By Marc Morano – Climate Depot Former Vice President Al Gore sounded a defeated tone and lamented the utter failure of the man-made global warming movement during a speech to the Aspen Institute in Colorado on August 4, 2011. Gore used multiple curse words in an emotional speech that revealed his deep frustration and all but conceded defeat to global warming skeptics.

Defeated Gore unleashes: ‘It’s no longer acceptable in mixed company, meaning bipartisan company, to use the goddamn word ‘climate’...we cannot possibly come to an agreement on it’ - August 5, 2011

As Climate Depot has noted, a movement that had Al Gore – one of the most divisive political figures -– as the face of the movement, was bound to fail. And a movement that utilized the scandal ridden United Nations – which is massively distrusted by the American people—as the repository of science, was doomed to fail. The movement Gore helped found, is dying scientifically, politically and economically.
