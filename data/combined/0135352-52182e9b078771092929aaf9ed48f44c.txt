Sports Donga via Naver1. [+8,492, -165] I feel bad for her... She was in a DSP group named Puretty that debuted in Korea and Japan 3 years ago that disbanded after one or two singles. She was also in KARA Project and won #1 in expert votes all the time but lost the spot of KARA's new member to Youngji, who didn't even attend two missions and won based on global fan votes alone. She then had to work through Sojin's suicide after KARA Project while still managing to debut as April's group leader... As a fan, I know that she wanted this more than anything so I don't understand why she's leaving now ㅠㅠㅠ The truth remains with DSP and herself...2. [+6,910, -208] She trained for four years and finally debuted with April but she's voluntarily leaving now? And even writing a handwritten letter like this? Something's fishy...3. [+6,307, -157] Is it not a waste of all the time she spent training??? I honestly see this as DSP kicking her out4. [+4,781, -266] Who knows whether she wrote that letter because she wanted to or she was forced... poor kids left behind, tsk tsk.5. [+866, -17] Is this going to be a second Hong Yookyung case?? You really can't believe companies when they say voluntarily leave anymore...6. [+802, -5] I bet her agency made her leave. DSP is so weird.7. [+687, -9] It makes no sense for someone who trained for four years to suddenly want to leave like this. 100% the agency forced her to. Why are they being like this to a kid who struggled so hard leading up to this point.. I've been supporting her since Baby KARA. Somin, find strength. I hope you find luck and prove DSP wrong.8. [+638, -11] There's that old saying, if something sounds illogical, there's usually something fishy going on. She's been working towards this dream for years now and she's giving it up just a few months into her debut??? How laughable! Who forced you to write this letter? How dare they treat a human being like this!9. [+587, -14] I feel so bad for her.. I want to ask her why she made this decision... and if she even really wanted this at all
