In a rare bright spot among 2016 election results, California's Proposition 60, which would have deputized citizens to sue porn stars for not wearing condoms, was soundly defeated Tuesday. With 96 percent of votes counted, around 54 percent of California voters have rejected the proposition and 46 percent supported it.

For background on the now-defeated ballot initiative, check out this post of mine from yesterday.

Here's how sex workers and other folks in the adult-film industry have been reacting to the news:
