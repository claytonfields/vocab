Recently, our beloved Supreme Leader and Executive Grabber at Large, divulged a portion of his vast knowledge. The recipients of this coveted historical account invoking Andrew Jackson were his loyal subjects who all seem to have misplaced their silly hats. They still however believe that only the Leader’s immediate family is apt to making their kingdom great again..and believe with equal conviction that the Emolument Clause is strictly for the Snowflaked and Libtarded. His Grabbiness has evidently pivoted from having Reagan as his mentor to Jackson, citing the fact that he likes presidents who don’t acquire strange afflictions such as Alzheimer’s.

As a Libtarded snowflake who gets extremely bothered and frightened every time Trump lifts a pen or opens his mouth, I was very troubled by a particular fact that sufficed in the crash course of reinforcing his followers’ belief in white supremacy. Well, the whole speech bothered me as do all of them, but the fact that Andrew Jackson hated the Civil War WHICH HAPPENED 16 YEARS AFTER HE DIED, touched my soul. And so, without much further ado, here is a historical timeline inspired by this new development:
