A New York police officer who was arrested for stealing money from Hispanic drivers was due in court on Monday to face additional charges.

Video from a sting in January showed 50-year-old Suffolk County Police Sgt. Scott Greene pulling over an undercover officer and stealing $100. At the time, he was charged with petty larceny and official misconduct.

But officials said that additional charges could be filed.

“In my view he’s clearly profiling Hispanics,” Suffolk County District Attorney Tom Spota. “I had the car driven by a Latino undercover police officer from the District Attorney’s office to see if the sergeant would take the bait. And indeed, the first time we tried, he took the bait.”

“It’s always a sad day when we have to announce the arrest of a police officer,” he added.

Although Spota said that Greene turned over the $100 bill when he was confronted, the 25-year police veteran has pleaded not guilty to the initial charges.





Earlier this month, Suffolk County District Attorney’s office spokesperson Irma Solis said that 13 people had made complaints in addition to the three incidents that Greene was already connected to. And four other people were afraid to speak out.

Spota said that Green was scheduled to appear in state Supreme Court in Central Islip on Monday.
