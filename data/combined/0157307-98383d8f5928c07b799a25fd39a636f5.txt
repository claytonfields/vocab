Bob Weir & RatDog Cancel Remaining Tour Dates

Bob Weir & RatDog have announced that will cancel all remaining tour dates, including their Jamaica multi-day event scheduled for January 2015. Full refunds will be offered. Weir has also cancelled his appearance with Furthur at the second annual Lockn’ festival in September.

No further information was made available as to why this decision was made, though Weir was recently “under the weather” and missed a RatDog show in Las Vegas in July. Here’s a look at the full statement via Furthur’s Facebook page:

Circumstances have necessitated that all scheduled tour dates for Bob Weir & RatDog are being cancelled. This applies to all dates on the summer tour starting on Thursday, August 14 in Boston through September 14 in Nashville and also includes the Jamaica event in January of 2015. Full and complete refunds are available at place of purchase. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience.

Weir’s camp also told Relix and Jambands.com that Weir will remain off the road “immediately and indefinitely.”

UPDATE:

Weir’s former manager, John Scher, has told Rolling Stone:

I love the guy and wish nothing but good health…He’s an extremely talented and very underrated musician. He’s an important guy. Bobby’s been having health problems for a while and now there are plenty of people who support him and want to help him get the care he needs.
