About

For years, I have pursued my passion for illustration. I even worked as a designer, for a time, until I realized that working as an artist on someone else's clock was not for me. I have always wanted to share the work I do, especially the fun stuff. I wanted to create something that could be shared and enjoyed and would cost next to nothing.

The Big Conspiracy Coloring Pack was born out of my interest in the weird and unusual. Since I was a just a wee lad, I have thoroughly enjoyed tales of Bigfoots and ufos. I relish the stories of hollow moons and subterranean humanoids. Oh, how I love to entertain the ideas of kindred spirits from the stars or just beyond our plane of sensory perception.

My hope here is to share these family-friendly drawings with people who enjoy the lighter side of these controvestial subjects. I want to share them as inexpensively as possible. The drawings are 600 dpi, 11x14 jpgs. Print them out or open them in your favorite editor. Enjoy them with your cheeky friends!

All of my equipment is paid for and good but it is getting old and will need to be upgraded, so my main intention is to get a little more modern equipment and continue putting out fun drawings for the people!
