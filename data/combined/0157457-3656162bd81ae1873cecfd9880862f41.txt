The Reform Party is demanding a full account from the Prime Minister with regard to any use of state resources in connection with the defamation suit involving blogger, Roy Ngerng in his private capacity as Mr Lee Hsien Loong.



The Reform Party wrote in the letter addressed to the Prime Minister Office stating that it is concerned that PM Lee is currently engaged in a defamation suit with Ngerng in his personal capacity, citing that any ministers involved in legal proceedings in a personal capacity may have implications for them in their official position.

It is of PM Lee’s admission that he is seeking a significant sum in excess of S$400,000 against the unemployed former health worker blogger is a private matter and has nothing to do with the official duties of the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), wrote the party.

It went on to ask if PM Lee can assure the citizens that he can carry out his duties as a public servant funded by the taxpayer and simultaneously be engaged in a legal wrangle which has now reached the high court, without significant impact on those official duties and ask for such assurances to be made public.

In the letter signed off by Secretary General, Kenneth Jeyaretnam, “PM must give a clear and detailed accounting of all or any taxpayer-funded state resources, official resources, official machinery and official personnel used in the period starting with the monitoring of bloggers, research and information gathering through to the issuing of legal letters, the follow-up, the subsequent legal action and the current hearings to assess damages and the media and PR management throughout.”

The party explained that it believes that there is a need for the prime minster to inform the public as to how much time and what resources were expended by state legal officers and civil servants in advising the PM on the implications of legal proceedings in his personal capacity due potential implications for conflict.

TOC understands that Reform Party has sent the letter to the Prime Minister Office on the matter.
