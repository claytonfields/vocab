It’s a marathon. Not a sprint.

That was the mantra echoed on Capitol Hill in Washington on Tuesday when 26 cyclists arrived to bring attention once again to reducing gun violence. They traveled close to 400 miles — riding from Newtown, Conn., all the way to the nation’s capital in four days. Four of the riders are from Newtown; the others from all over the United States.

They call themselves “Team 26.” Twenty-six riders in honor of each person killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.

Team 26 hopes their ride will send a message to Congress to strengthen gun-control laws to prevent more tragedies like the one in Sandy Hook from happening again. But 15 months after Newtown, these advocates say they’re not giving up the fight.

“This movement is no longer just about Newtown. But it’s about how America is uniting and demanding that our children be allowed to grow up and pursue their dreams,” said Monte Frank, Team 26’s leader.

Watch as Team 26 calls on Congress to put gun-control efforts back on the agenda.
