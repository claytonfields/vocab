A regional leader of Winston McKenzie’s party has defended his homophobic comments on Celebrity Big Brother… by claiming a Muslim housemate would actually murder gays.

Outspoken homophobe Winston McKenzie, who was a candidate for the UK Independence Party until last year, entered the Celebrity Big Brother house last night.

McKenzie did not leave it long before making homophobic jokes, saying: “I could cope with a homosexual in the house. I guess I’ll just have to stand with my back against a brick wall all the time.”

However, Steve Uncles of the English Democrats – the party McKenzie is currently a member of – has defended his comments.

He tweeted: “Next year #CBB will have a Muslim house mate actually chucking gays house mates from roof #Culturalenrichment

“Muslim culture to chuck gays from tall buildings, Christian culture to stand against wall … guess which ones gets gays going.”



He added: “The Gay ‘community’ are like NAZIS when it comes to freedom of speech”

“You remain silent when Muslims chuck Gay people from buildings, but get hysterical over ‘tongue in cheek’ comments.

“Just think next year they will have a real Muslim chucking gays off buildings!”

McKenzie has previously claimed that same-sex adoption is child abuse said he was ‘dismayed’ to find out that Kellie Maloney is transgender.

Despite being purportedly ‘sacked’ many times by UKIP, Mr McKenzie was once again UKIP’s PPC in the seat of Croydon North last year.

However, he announced late last year that he had quit the party to join the far-right English Democrats.

Uncles is standing as the party’s candidate for Police and Crime Commissioner in Kent.
