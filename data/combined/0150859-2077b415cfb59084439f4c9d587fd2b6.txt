GLENDALE, Ariz. â€” Peyton Manning got "sick and nauseous" to know he was included in an Al Jazeera report that claimed to expose current NFL players allegedly using human growth hormone.

As for Clay Matthews, who was the target of similar allegations while at USC, he called BS on being tied to HGH again.

The Packers' linebacker didn't hold back, fresh off being frustrated in his team's 38-8 loss in Arizona.

"I think it is bulls--t," Matthews said. "I mean to be completely honest with you, it's 100 percent falsified and fabricated information. I don't know who this guy is. I couldn't tell you what he looks like. I have never talked to him ro communicated with him, so for him to bring my name up like that out of thin air is bulls--t for a lack fo a better term."

The guy to whom Matthews is referring is pharmacist Charlie Sly, who already told ESPN he "made up" the story on Manning getting HGH while recovering from neck surgery four years ago.

Matthews does believe that people should believe him, and not buy into the report.

"I work hard on my reputation and really that is all I have," Matthews added. "For seven years I worked my ass off and for this guy to say those type of things is not true and for him to recant everything he said too just shows the type of source he is. The truth will come out. I am not worried about it because I carry myself a certain way and that is the right way."
