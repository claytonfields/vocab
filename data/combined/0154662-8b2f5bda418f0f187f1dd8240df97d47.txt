NM: I would like to congratulate the organisers of 'Big Fight,' because till last Monday, the Indian media, even after many reasons, did not have the courage to use the term "Islamic terrorism," because they were so influenced by their pseudo-secularism that they did not have the courage to tell the truth. Last Tuesday, the media of the world started writing about this after the American incident for the 1st time, and I congratulate this initiative taken by Rajdeep, that they have had the courage to depict the truth in its original form.

As far as Islam goes, it has many good aspects in it.Today how people are using Islam, that is the real question. When a religion says that "my religion is different that yours, better that yours, and till the time you don't take refuge under me you will not attain moksha (freedom from reincarnation/ the cycle of life) or go to Allah or Jesus," it then starts a conflict. And in my opinion, India has given the world the ideology of truth is one, but it is called in different ways. If there is a general acceptance that every religion is the same, then there is no conflict. But when I say that your religion is (nikamma) and that mine is right, it leads to conflict and creates hatred and that hatred goes on to join politics than terrorism spreads. Since the 14th Century, the quest to rule the world has resulted it the current situation.

RS: Mr Modi, your time is up.

NM: Instead of cursing the ideology of Islam, we must focus on the elements that are misusing it.

RS: Mr Modi, your time is up. We haven't used the word "Islamic terrorism," we have only raised the question. So we don't need the compliments from you at the moment. But Dr Zakaria, respond to Mr Modi.

Z: Should I respond in Hindi or in English?

RS: English, please.

Z: Well, I would have liked to have replied in Hindi. But you know this is the outcome of the Muslim phobia which unfortunately hasn't left people like Mr Modi - I am very sorry to say that - simply because some media in the United States called what happened last Tuesday ("Islamic Terrorism"), as far as the bombing of the New York buildings and the Pentagon that for the first time, the Indian media has realised that it is "Islamic Terrorism." Now, what has Islam to do with whoever is responsible? As far as...

Mr Modi tries to continue his previous line of argument that Islamic Terrorism and Islam have nothing in common, not realising that by using the "Islamic" prefix, he is automatically linking it to Islam. Furthermore, Mr Modi, while supposedly preaching against differentiating between religions and religious beliefs, constantly seems to imply a firm divide between the Hindus, and specifically the BJP, and Muslims.

The floor was given to Mr Parthasarthy, who also stressed on the importance of not combining religion and terrorism, asking Mr Modi also not to do the same.

Siddharth Vardharajan comments on Mr Modi's point of view.

John Elliot questions Mr Modi on the implications that the growth of Islamic terrorism will have on communal relations within the country.

Mr Modi claims that he and his party have never linked religion and terrorism much to the exasperation of the mediators. When asked for an assurance for the same by Rajdeep Sardesai, Mr Modi suddenly shifts tracks and never gives a direct answer.

NM: I don't know what phobia he is having. I do not understand what phobia Dr Zakaria is having. I, myself, say it has nothing to do with Islam. Those who are using religion for this bad interest... (?)

RS: Just a minute, Mr Modi. You used the word "Islamic Terrorism," you were actually praising us in this program and suddenly...

NM: Yes, because in India, the pseudo-secular people are not ready to raise this type of question before. But only because the western media started, you have adopted it.

RS: So you mean suddenly, we are no longer pseudo-secular?

Z: So what he's trying to (say) is, that he happy that now whomsoever he calls pseudo-secular, that they have also now realised that really it is "Islamic Terrorism." That shows what really disturbs him.

RS: Right. Mr Parthasarathy just pointed out what Dr Zakaria just said. (?)

P: I think I'll come to what is really happening, and what is called "Islamic Terrorism" on hand to make my presentation. My query to Mr Modi is that there are certain noble tenets to Islam, as you have yourself remarked, Islam says you will not harm civilians. Islam, for example, says that even if you hurt one innocent human being, that it is a crime against humanity. Mr Modi, don't you think it is right now incumbent, firstly on our entire political leadership and I particularly call on the leadership also of the Muslim community of India, to draw a distinction between the misuse of Islamic tenets by zealots in our neighbourhood on the one hand, by Pakistan in particular, on the one hand and being very careful not label an entire religion or an entire religious order in those terms?

NM: I 100% agree with Mr Parthasarthy because you cannot blame a religion, and one should not. And we are not against any religion, and any Hindu can never be. This is the basic thinking of the Indian philosophy and that's why...

RS: And yet you say that from 14 century Islam has used religion for militancy...

NM: The problem is the misuse of the emotional feeling, and whether it comes from religion or something else; that is the danger to the society.

RS: Okay. Siddharth, question?

SV: I'll make two quick points or questions. You said no Hindu can be opposed to religion.You, yourself, a few moments ago started by separating "Islamic Terrorism" from Islam, and then you made a judgement on Islam as being a religion which so called downgrades other people, religions, etc. So, in other words, you are commenting negatively on the religion itself.

Second question - you seem to be very enamoured by the western media's description of "Islamic Terrorism." Do you know what the western media refers to your party as; the BJP? They use the phrase "Hindu Fundamentalist." Do you accept that phrase?

NM: We don't accept it. In democracy, they have every right to say. In democracy, why should I say that they cannot say? This is what the difference is between us and others; they say if you say this, the gun is there. I say "no, I'll accept it."

SV: Is the western media being pseudo-secular when they refer to the BJP as "Hindu Fundamentalists"?

NM: If you want to debate on pseudo-secularism, I am ready to debate on that.

RS: Okay, that's another issue.

NM: But your issue was different. Tell, Mr John, what is your question?

JE: If the fear of Islamic terrorism builds up in this country, what would it do to the communal relations?

NM: As far as relations with each and every community is concerned, India is bound to have good relation with each and every citizen of this country. If terror (?), we have to isolate this terrorist activity, we have to isolate terrorists, we have to curb their lifelines and then we will be able to handle them.

RS: But how are you isolating terrorists, Mr Modi, when every time an incident like this occurs you raise the religious, you bring in the religious agenda? You are linking it at some stage - religion and terrorism.

NM: We, as far as the BJP is concerned, we never do that.

RS: Oh My God!

NM: How are you going to blame me...

RS: You just did it...

NM (continuing):...When myself, I am saying (RS: Oh My God) that Islam has nothing to with these things, but those who are using Islam for this purpose are a danger to the society. And if even a Hindu is doing this type of activity with the help of religion, it is a danger.

JE: It is a dangerous road. We have seen what happened to Sikhs in America over the last few days; because they wear turbans, that they assume they look like Osama Bin Laden. If you build this up too far, what are you going to do to the relations of your country. Isn't it dangerous?

NM: It is a surprise for the world that even they don't have this much general knowledge, as American citizens; that because only they have a turban, they think they are the Taliban people. I am very sorry to say... (?)

RS: Okay. Why don't you give one assurance that during... There will be an election campaign, for example, in Uttar Pradesh, you will not use the incidents of Tuesday to stir a communal divide, to label every Muslim in this country somewhere down the line as an Islamic terrorist. Are you willing to give that assurance?

NM: It's a tragic condition in my Indian media that such a challenge to the humanity, and you are talking about the footpath politics! What are we doing? When the people are talking about the challenge to the humanity, and we talking about Uttar Pradesh, and this (?), and that (?). What more(?) of footpath politics are we going to do? This is the challenge against the humanity...

RS: Are you going to give it?

NM (continuing): ... And we will have to face this challenge and talk about the humanity.

RS: Okay, you are unwilling to answer the direct question. After the break, we'll get Dr Rafiq Zakaria to give us a perspective from an Islamic scholar.

Dr Zakaria attributes the oft believed Islamic belief on Kaffirs to the Muslim rulers of India, who, according to him, had nothing to do with Islam's tenets.



Mr Vardharajan questions Dr Zakaria with regard to his opinion on the attacks being related to US policy in the Middle-East.



Rajdeep Sardesai seeks an explanation from Dr Zakaria as to how Al Qaeda manages to use Islam quite so easily to woo supporters to its cause, given the nobility of the tenets of Islam.



Dr Zakaria attempts to refute the veracity of this question by suggesting that the principles of a religion have been manipulated in a number of religions to propagate terrorist activity. Although his intention was to deflect the likelihood of religion being linked to terrorism, and specifically Islam, he actually provides a great deal of credence to Mr Sardesai's question.

NM: They say those who are Kafirs, they have no right to live.

Z: Why are you mixing the teaching of Islam with what some of the rulers in India did, who had nothing to do as far as practising the tenets of Islam?

RS: Okay, let's look at what happened on Tuesday. Question Siddharth for Dr Zakaria.

SV: Dr Zakaria, I was just wondering how much of what happened on Tuesday is the product of US policies in the Arab world, in your opinion.

Z: Well, I mean, whether it was the reaction to what is happening in Palastine and in other countries, I do not know. But if it is bin Laden, then there is something more sinister in it, and I don't think you can mix it up also with it because there is a particular group which is determined to create disturbance.

RS: How do you explain, very quickly Dr Zakaria, the fact is that the Al Qaeda group he has created has used religion all across the world, whether it's in Sudan, whether it's in Saudi Arabia; they are using it in Iraq, they want to use it in Libya, they have used it in Afghanistan. How do you explain that that religion can be so easily used if you say Islam tenets are so noble?

SV: Islam should be subjected to this kind of scrutiny and finger pointing. I want to shift the focus slightly, because it seems to me from what you have said and from what one understands of the situation, that terrorism is a essentially a political phenomenon. And I think this is true, particularly of west Asia; I think it is true of central Asia. Often people with political ambition or political grievances may turn to religion or misuse religion for political purposes. We have seen that in India with Mr Modi's party, for example. So, what do you feel about it? Aren't we better off looking at terrorism as a political phenomenon, rather than just trying to find out out this and that?



P: I think it is a political phenomenon with a religious dimension.

That breeds discontent, which takes a religious dimension. But what is important is that these things have now led to a networking on a religious basis; Osama's network on a religious basis extends into the middle east, it extends into the United States.

NM: The reason why terrorism today has become so powerful is that it contains fundamentalism. It is fundamentalism that is solely responsible for the current scenario. Second point - you must understand that Muslims, when I say Muslims it doesn't mean Islam, they have a political road map. They have divided the world into three parts:

1) Darul-Aman

2) Darul-Harab

3) Darul-Islam

Darul-Aman means "Land of Peace." Where Islam has reached there should be "Land of Peace," or the place where Islam is powerless there Darul-Aman should exist.

Darul-Harab is "Land of Conflict." Where there is power, fight and take over that place.

The third is Darul-Islam. To convert the whole world into Islam. With such motives, some political activists, those who belong to Islam they are doing these activities. Unless and until we don't understand these people, we cannot understand terrorism.

It seems surprising that Mr Parthasarthy would choose to reduce the support for the Arab countries to a sort of playground reciprocality - "I'll do this and you do that."
