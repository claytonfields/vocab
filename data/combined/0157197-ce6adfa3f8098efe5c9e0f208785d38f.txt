Situated west of Marbella in the beautiful Spanish countryside, a villa formerly owned by Prince is now on the market. The home—which Prince briefly occupied in the 1990s—is now on the market again after being refurbished by its current owner. Set on a 1.45-acre plot, the Spanish villa boasts 10 bedrooms (some appropriately decorated with purple walls or drapes) and 6 bathrooms. Guests can make a dramatic entrance through the grand foyer, which is equipped with a massive chandelier and a double staircase with white marble balustrades. The formal dining room features floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the backyard and a spiraling chandelier. Other first-floor rooms include a new kitchen, a breakfast room, a living room, and two master bedrooms with en suite bathrooms. Upstairs, the home features additional bedrooms with private terraces overlooking the sea.

Outside amenities include beautifully landscaped gardens decorated with subtropical trees, a tennis court, an outdoor heated pool, and 2,583 square feet of terraces. The property also features a three-car garage and additional parking for six vehicles. Rumored to be the inspiration for many of Prince’s songs, the idyllic estate is currently on the market for around $6 million.
