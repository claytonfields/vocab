The story of professional poker star Mike “The Mouth” Matusow is in development as a biopic by 1984 Professional Defense Contractors.

1984’s Adi Shankar and Spencer Silna are producing along with David Uslan. The project is based on Matusow’s 2009 autobiography “Check-Raising the Devil.”

Matusow’s story details his bouts with drugs, depression, promiscuous sex, jail, and suicidal depression along with his success as a four-time World Series of Poker bracelet winner and winning the 2005 World Series of Poker Tournament of Champions.

His nickname comes from his affinity for razzing other players during poker games.

1984 has also acquired the rights to the 2003 novel “Money to Burn: The Ultimate Bank Heist Thriller,” by first-time writer and current U.S. District Court Judge James B. Zagel. The novel centers around a judge robbing the Federal Reserve Bank in Chicago of $100 million in used money that is about to be destroyed.

1984’s credits includes “The Voices,” starring Ryan Reynolds, Gemma Arterton and Anna Kendrick; Joe Carnahan’s “The Grey,” starring Liam Neeson; and “Killing Them Softly,” starring Brad Pitt.
