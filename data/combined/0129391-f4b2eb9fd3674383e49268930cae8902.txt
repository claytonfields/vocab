Fasten your seatbelts, it's going to be a bumpy night: Donald Trump will participate in a Reddit Ask Me Anything event on Wednesday.

The Republican presidential nominee is scheduled to begin fielding questions online starting at 7 p.m. ET; users are invited to start posting inquiries at 6:30 p.m.

So whether you're curious about Trump's stance on immigration and healthcare, wonder where he gets his spray tan, or are just fascinated by slow-motion car crashes, grab some popcorn and visit www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald Wednesday evening.

As Mashable points out, the AMA begins on the third night of the Democratic National Convention—just before President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden are set to take the stage.

Obama has participated in several Reddit AMAs. During his first Q&A session in August 2012, the President drove such heavy traffic to the page that Reddit crashed more than a few times. Three months later—on the day of his second general election—Obama made a surprise appearance on Reddit, urging users to cast their vote before polls closed.

The AMA platform, where nothing is off limits, has played host to the rich and famous (Bill Gates, Chris Hadfield, Stan Lee, Michael Bolton, Peter Dinklage) and the everyman ("I buy guy's used socks on eBay!").
