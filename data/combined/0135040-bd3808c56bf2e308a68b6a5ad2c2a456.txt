The Department of Homeland Security is terminating immigration benefits for approximately 59,000 Haitians who were allowed to work in the U.S. under a provisional residency known as "Temporary Protected Status."

Those from Haiti protected by the program from deportation must leave the country within 18 months. Many of those who will be impacted by the order live in Florida and New York City.

Earlier this month, DHS announced Nicaraguan TPS beneficiaries have 14 months to leave the U.S. or qualify to remain in the U.S. legally through a different visa category.

Congress created TPS in 1990 to prevent deporting foreign nationals to insecure and dangerous countries as a result of natural disaster, armed conflict, or health epidemics.

Haitiâ€™s temporary status was established in 2010 following a powerful earthquake.

The Trump administration is pushing back on the original purpose of the program and claim it was not intended to allow immigrants to stay in the U.S. long-term.
