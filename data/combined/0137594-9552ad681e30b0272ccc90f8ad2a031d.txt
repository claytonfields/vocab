A woman used a fake doctor’s note to explain why she missed sentencing on forgery and burglary charges in Prince George’s County, prosecutors said.

Accused of renting out foreclosed homes she didn't own, Shannon Lee pleaded guilty, but she didn’t show up for sentencing July 11, claiming she was sick.

But the documents Lee submitted to prove she was sick were fake, prosecutors said.

“The attending physician and the admitting physician who are listed on the paperwork hadn’t practiced at that hospital in over two years, and further, the actual paperwork itself was not even the correct paperwork for that hospital for discharge information,” state’s attorney spokesman John Erzen said.

Court documents show Lee also listed a UPS store in Clinton as her home address on those medical documents.

She's expected to be sentenced in August.
