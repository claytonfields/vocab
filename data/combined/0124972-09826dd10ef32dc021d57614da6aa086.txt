Two men caught on home surveillance video on Archglen Way in San Jose.

A San Jose neighborhood is banding together, trying to find, shame and arrest a group of burglars who seem to be targeting their homes.

San Jose police have a good look at two potential burglary suspects: On Facebook, neighbors and friends, and even strangers, are sharing a photo of two men, smiling and looking quite upbeat, as they allegedly burglarized a home near 101 and Hellyer Avenue on Oct. 18.

According to neighbors, police had been in the neighborhood the day before, looking for prowlers who knocked on a front door and then took off in a getaway car.

San Jose police are asking members of the public to call them if they recognize either of the men.

Joe Lopez, a retired Santa Clara County Sheriff's deputy, said his neighbor two houses down was the one most recently burglarized, and he's glad his community is doing something -- by getting the word out themselves.

"This is a working-class neighborhood, so many of us are out working during the day," Lopez said. "I know it's difficult. So we all need to work together."
