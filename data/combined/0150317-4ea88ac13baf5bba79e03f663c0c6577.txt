The party has called on police to investigate charges of corruption against the Guptas & Zuma's son.

CAPE TOWN - Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane and the party's shadow finance minister David Maynier have called on police to investigate charges of corruption against the Guptas and President Jacob Zuma's son, Duduzane.

They've laid charges at the Cape Town Central Police Station.

Maimane says this is a betrayal of the country's democratic processes.

"This to us is tantamount to prima facie level that there is undue influence that's been exerted by the Guptas."

The DA has called for Zuma's removal.

CABINET MEMBERS MUM ON GUPTA JOB OFFERS

With the deputy finance minister and former African National Congress (ANC) MP Vytjie Mentor, confirming they'd been offered government jobs through the Guptas, other Cabinet ministers have declined to comment on whether they too have been approached by members of the influential family.

Eyewitness News has tried to contact almost all government ministers.

Most are unavailable.

Former Public Enterprises Minister Barbara Hogan this morning confirmed she was pressured to meet with officials from a Gupta-linked airline over its business interests. She says she refused.

Mentor upped the ante today, saying she has proof President Jacob Zuma was in the same house when the Gupta family offered her a cabinet position.

Meanwhile, former ANC MP professor Ben Turok says the president must publically disassociate himself from the Gupta family at this weekend's NEC meeting.

He says the NEC must ask Zuma some very direct questions this weekend.

"The president says it is a matter of friendship but recent events seem to indicate that the relationship is much deeper than that. So please tell us, what is your relationship? Secondly on whose authority did Gupta make the proposal to the deputy minister?"
