Take that! HD remakes of all three Phoenix Wright games are coming to iPad and iPhone this fall, publisher Capcom said today.

You'll be able to download an app called Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy HD for free, then buy the three games in the trilogy: Ace Attorney, Justice for All, and Trials and Tribulations.

The app will ship with a free demo of Ace Attorney's first two chapters. It will also have a bunch of other silly features, Capcom says:

Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy HD will also come with the "Everyone Object" mode (at no additional cost) to help players communicate their displeasure of everyday situations with the help of popular Ace Attorney characters and sayings. With a simple touch of a button, the phrases, "Objection!", "Hold it!", and "Take that!" can be emailed to friends or tweeted along with an animated image.

In other words, there will soon be a way to instantly send Phoenix Wright gifs to everyone you know. Yes. Feel free to post your favorites in the comments.

No word on whether the fourth game, Apollo Justice, or any of the other Ace Attorney and Miles Edgeworth games will make their way to iOS at any point soon.
