The Drudge Report on Wednesday pondered whether Pope Francis, who has recently fallen out of favor with some conservatives, is actually the “antichrist,” noting that the pope’s “stand on homosexuality, Islam, capitalism, and the New World Order” fuel chatter.

Drudge links to an article on Charisma News explaining, “Why So Many People Think Pope Francis Is the Antichrist.” The post asks whether Francis’ role as antichrist signifies the second coming of Christ.

If you type “is Pope Francis antichrist” into Google, you’ll get about 425,000 results in .37 seconds. By way of comparison, if you ask Google the same question about Pope Benedict you only get 137,000 and it takes a little longer—.47 seconds.

Charisma News cites a Gallup poll released earlier in July that found Pope Francis’ popularity taking a serious hit among conservatives.

The pope has taken criticism recently from conservatives over his stances on climate change and economic inequality. Charisma News also noted that Pope Francis has “warmed up to Islam.”

The post’s author, Jennifer LeClaire, concludes by citing “chatter” and asking whether Pope Francis’s role as pope may predict the end of days:

Could Francis be the final pope before Christ’s return? Could he be the Antichrist? Is he the False Prophet? The chatter continues.

Here’s what we know: More than 50 years ago, a Jesuit priest predicted the resignation of Pope Benedict—to the day—and now Tom Horn, who worked with Cris Putnam to unveil a 900-year-old prophecy buried in the library at the Vatican that describes a series of 112 popes, and others are looking at his research. “Was he divinely inspired? Was he demonically inspired?” Horn asks. “Because we know demons know things about times and dispensations, too.”
