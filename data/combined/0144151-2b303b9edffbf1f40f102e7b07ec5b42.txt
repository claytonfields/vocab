– The man who helped Denver Police officers capture a suspect received special recognition on Friday and a new bicycle.

Back in June, Aaron Miripol was riding a B-cycle on the Cherry Creek trail when he saw a suspect run through the creek.

Police knew Jose Delgado, wanted on multiple felony warrants, would run when they confronted him.

“As I keep riding there’s a guy running in front of me, probably 50 meters up, running across the water, and that’s when I realize that’s who they’re running after,” said Miripol.

“I said, ‘Take the bike’ … I said, ‘Take the bike.’ He’s like, ‘Are you sure?’ … I said, ‘Yeah, take it.’ And he got him!”

Delgado was trapped by the walls of the trail when officers finally caught up to him on a footbridge in Confluence Park, tackling him before he could jump back in the water.

On Friday, Denver Police Chief Robert White honored Miripol with his very own bicycle, helmet and bike lock, as a way to say thank you for helping capture the suspect.
