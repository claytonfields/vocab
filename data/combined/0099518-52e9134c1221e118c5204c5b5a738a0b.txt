Amsterdam Releases Pair of Adventure Brews at Retail Stores

TORONTO, ON – Amsterdam Brewery has announced the retail release of two Adventure Brews, the brewery’s on-going series of one-off, collaborative and small batch beers.

Available now in 473 ml cans is Starke Pilsner, a beer that has been a favourite at the Amsterdam BrewHouse since it was first made available there on draught last year. The 5.8% abv Czech-style lager is described as “a refreshing golden Pilsner with a rich body and some spicy, grassy notes from the hops as well as a slight resiny finish.”

Out in 650 ml bottles is Shape Shifter, a 10% abv strong ale brewed in collaboration with Indie Ale House. Aged in Cognac and Madeira barrels for 5 months, it’s described as having “flavours of dark fruit and vanilla with a sturdy oak, treacle and caramel.”

Both beers are available now in the retail stores at the Amsterdam Brewery (45 Esandar Drive) and BrewHouse (245 Queens Quay West) in Toronto.
