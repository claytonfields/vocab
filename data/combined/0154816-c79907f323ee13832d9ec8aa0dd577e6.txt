Austin Spurs' Patricio Garino and Bryn Forbes combined for 48 points as the duo led Austin to a 115-109 win over the Texas Legends.

The Spurs erased a 28-point deficit but it was a tale of two halves as the Legends, led by Manny Harris, came out in the first quarter to score 67 points while holding the Spurs to 48. Harris finished with 21 points.

The second half came and the Spurs looked more engaged as they were in the first half. Bryn Forbes, who was held to just three points in the first half, came out firing on all cylinders to start the third quarter.

Forbes would pace the Spurs who nearly matched their first half output with scoring 42 points in the third. Forbes caught fire scoring 15 in the quarter including three from downtown. He finished with 22 points.

Heading into the fourth quarter, the Spurs saw themselves with momentum and being down by just two points.



Patricio Garino who was quite in the first half, came alive in the final period for Austin. He finished with a game high 26 points and used his length to get himself to the basket.

Garino did a great job slashing to the basket, being aggressive on both ends of the floor and displaying nice inside-outside game.

Not to be outdone, Corey Jefferson finished with another double-double, his 12th of the season, finishing with 18 points and 14 rebounds.



The Spurs outscored the Legends 67-42 to cap off the win.
