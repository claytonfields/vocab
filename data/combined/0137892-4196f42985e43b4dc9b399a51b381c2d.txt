Football season may be over, but not for one Mississauga football fan.

Just in time for Christmas, Kelly Hardy has made a detailed gingerbread replica of Ottawa Redblacks’ TD Place Stadium to show her love for Canadian football.

Every part of the creation is edible, except for the picture of Redblacks receiver Greg Ellingson, which towers above the green, sugar-coated field on a gingerbread scoreboard.

The goalposts are made of Popeye candy sticks. Red and black M&Ms scatter the gingerbread stands to serve as seats. TD Place’s distinctive wooden veil is replicated with pretzel sticks that wrap around one of the stands. A football – a peanut M&M decorated in icing – sits at the side of the field.

The stadium took about 20 hours to make.

Hardy said this is actually the seventh stadium she’s built. The idea first came about 10 years ago.

“I was watching a gingerbread competition on TV and thought, ‘Oh, I should build something,’ and I thought houses were a little cliché,” Hardy said.

So she decided to build a football stadium.

She began with Mosaic Stadium, home of the Saskatchewan Roughriders, and made her way through most of the teams until deciding on Ottawa this year.

TD Place is one of the few stadiums in the country she’s actually visited, and with the Redblacks’ recent Grey Cup victory, she said the choice for the gingerbread stadium was obvious.

“Everybody’s always delighted by (the tasty sculptures),” said Hardy of her gingerbread creations. “I think it’s fun to see your stadium rendered in gingerbread.”

Hardy said she plans on making stadiums for all the CFL teams. She only has two left: the BC Lions and the Toronto Argonauts.

“We might see what kind of season each team has, and if one of them wins the Grey Cup, then that might be the deciding factor.”
