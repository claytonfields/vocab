It’s the day after the Super Bowl and the talk all around the internet is, of course, the big game and everyone’s favorite commercial (Imported from Detroit!). Amidst all this, trying to fly under the radar is Blizzard, making their announcement for dates for their sixth Blizzcon at the Anaheim Convention Center. This year the dates for the convention will be on October 21st and 22nd in Anaheim, CA. Of course Blizzard will be showcasing their three main titles at the convention—Warcraft, Starcraft and Diablo.

“We look forward to holding another exciting BlizzCon this year, filled with some great entertainmet and competition, as well as the latest news about Blizzard games,” said Mike Morhaime, CEO and cofounder of Blizzard Entertainment. “BlizzCon is built from the ground up with our community in mind—we’re pleased to be able to host an event where players can come together to have fun and celebrate their passion for gaming.”

If you never been to a BlizzCon event, here is some of the things you get to enjoy while attending the two days of Blizzard goodness:

Hands-on play time with the latest versions of Blizzard Entertainment games

Discussion panels with Blizzard Entertainment developers

Competitive and casual tournaments for players to showcase their talents

Community contests with great prizes

Commemorative merchandise based on Blizzard Entertainment’s game universes

More activities and attractions to be announced.

I really hope that this is the year that Blizzard announces their new IP that they have been talking about for the last two years. I went to my first BlizzCon back in 2009 and I hope to go again this year.
