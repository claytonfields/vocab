Everyone loves free stuff. Between the thrill of feeling like you're getting away with something and the lack of impact on your bank account, in today's cash-driven world, freebies are something that no one can resist.

The phenomenon has been well-documented on reality shows for extreme couponers, who fill their homes with extra toilet paper and soup cans, all for the sum total of zero dollars. But for those who don't have the inclination to clip coupons -- or the storage space for the results -- free stuff can come in other forms too.

The video above doles out seven tips for finding ways to get meals for free. They range from plausible (taking advantage of birthday specials) to questionable (volunteering at a soup kitchen for the free meal reward), but they do all have the same end result -- a meal that costs you nothing but perhaps a bit of dignity.

Testing out the free stuff waters can be a slippery slope -- websites abound that cater just to your needs -- but if it helps you save a bit of money, there's no real harm in it. Just remember, your friends will want you to foot the bill at some point too.
