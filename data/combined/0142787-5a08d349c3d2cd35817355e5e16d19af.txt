9:15 PM: One person has been taken to the hospital after a motorcycle crash at West Marginal Way South/South Holden, by the entrance to northbound Highway 99 (north of the South Transfer Station; map), commonly used if you head down the Highland Park Way hill toward 99. It appeared on the 911 log as a medic response about an hour ago but wasn’t on our radar until Megan tipped us that it was snarling traffic; police have since reopened most of the road, but if you’re heading that way and can wait a bit, that might be a good idea. Police tell us at the scene they’re still trying to find out what happened; no word on the rider’s condition.

SUNDAY MORNING UPDATE: Police say the rider does not have life-threatening injuries. But they are trying to find the reported hit-run driver who caused the crash. Just added to SPD Blotter:
