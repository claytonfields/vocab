SAN ANTONIO - A man is dead and woman has been taken to the hospital in a shooting on the city's far North Side, San Antonio police said Friday.

The shooting was reported just before 7:30 a.m. in the 3600 block of Ivory Creek. That's in a neighborhood found near Loop 1604 and Rodgers Ranch.

Police said when they arrived on scene they found a man and a woman both in their 40s with gunshot wounds in separate rooms, on the ground floor of a two-story home.

The man was pronounced dead at the scene. The woman in the home was taken to an area hospital. Her condition is not presently known.

Officials tell KSAT 12 that they are not searching for anyone else in regards to the shooting. However they would not confirm who shot who.

A next-door neighbor said she was told that the husband did the shooting. Two other neighbors said the couple who lived in the home had not been married long.

Additional neighbors said the children who live in the home were not present at the time of the shooting and had likely gone to school.

KSAT 12 will continue to follow this story and have more information as it develops.
