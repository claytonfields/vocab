Steven Gerrard will miss the LA Galaxy's penultimate match of the season against the Houston Dynamo and his status for the remainder of the season is still up in the air.

Gerrard returned to Liverpool earlier this week to rehab a nagging hamstring injury that sidelined him for much of September. The midfielder returned from the injury late last month and went 68 minutes in the Galaxy's 1-0 defeat to FC Dallas two weeks ago.

“Steven had a re-occurrence of his hamstring injury. He’s obviously out for a bit,” Arena, who confirmed that Gerrard's status is still 'day to day,' told Spectrum SportsNet. “He could do at home what he could do here as well. It was OK for him to depart for a week or two.”

The 36-year-old midfielder is expected to return by early next week and could return by this weekend, but will not participate in Sunday's match against the Houston Dynamo. Arena confirmed that the team will have to "wait and see" when Gerrard, who has made 21 appearances with three goals and 11 assists this season will return to the field.
