New Orleans Saints safety Jairus Byrd did not participate in the early portion of practice open to the media on Thursday.

Two players were absent. Offensive Terron Armstead, who has often missed practice time while playing through a knee injury, was not present. Receiver Marques Colston appeared to be taking his normal veteran's rest day.

Guard Jahri Evans, who missed the last two games due to injury, participated in the early portion of practice on Thursday.

The Saints will issue an official injury report later Thursday afternoon that sometimes differs from the unofficial observations from media.

The Saints (5-8) play the Detroit Lions (4-9) on Monday night at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome.

Byrd hasn't missed any games or practices since making his debut on Oct. 4 after sitting out most of the preseason and the first three games of the regular season with a knee injury.

Two new players were present at Thursday's practice. Running back Kendall Hunter wore No. 46 and cornerback Tony Carter was No. 37.

Practice squad running back Bronson Hill, previously assigned No. 37, is now No. 46.

New practice squad receiver Shane Wynn wore No. 19.
