Arsene Wenger is facing a keeper crisis after David Ospina was ruled out with a back injury.

It leaves Wenger having to play third choice keeper Emiliano Martinez against West Ham - and he could have to play for the next fortnight.

Ospina suffered an injury after a heavy fall against Manchester City on Sunday and it is understood that he is out injured.

That comes on top of first choice Petr Cech being ruled out with a calf problem for at least another two weeks.

Martinez has played three games in the League Cup this season and is not a rookie but it will still be a worry as he could be up against West Hamâ€™s giant striker Andy Carroll.

Ospina is set to leave Arsenal this summer - Marseille are keen on him as well as interest from Turkey - and this latest injury worry is a major setback.

It could mean that Martinez has to deputise for the next few games.

Arsenal have recalled rookie keeper Matt Macey from his loan spell at Luton to ease the crisis with Ospina and Cech out.
