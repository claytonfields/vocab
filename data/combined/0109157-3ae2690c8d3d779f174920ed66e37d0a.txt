Let me rephrase, banana pancakes for unbelievably lazy people. Woo! I don’t know if I can even call this a recipe because they turn out different (differently?) every time, but they usually satisfy my bananary cravings. I have literally had them for breakfast before, cheekily doubled the recipe for dinner and they have definitely made me too full once or twice when I’ve eaten them for dessert and probably shouldn’t have had that earlier second helping of rice.

You can do whatever you like with these: I’ve had them with fresh or stewed berries before, added a bit of yoghurt or (impatiently) let a square of dark chocolate melt on top – err yum! You could totally throw in some toasted nuts, dessicated coconut, fro-yo! Aaaaanything.

Makes 3 small pancakes – suitable for a second breakfast or dessert after a light (or, in my case, any) dinner.

Ingredients

5 tbsp self-raising flour

4 tbsp milk

1 ripe banana (I like to keep it partially unmashed. I mean I would never say no to some caramelised banana chunks. Or sometimes, when I’m feeling really bananary, I mash about 3/4 and rip up the rest into the mixture.)

Method

Mash the banana. Mix in the milk. Fold in the flour. Fry, pressing down a little, a little oil (coconut oil is the best because I love the nutty fragrance it gives!)

Love a good healthy but actually nice tasting plate of food!

I know they don’t look like the fluffiest stack of pancakes with an action shot of maple syrup being drizzled over and the (in my opinion) not-always-called-for rashers of crispy bacon sat on top, but number 1: I don’t think they particularly need any sweetener if your bananas are ripe enough and you have some nice accompaniments with it. And number 2, you’re just gonna have to bear with me and my amateur picture-taking skills until I become a pro at using my currently under-achieving DLR, which isn’t fulfilling its full potential at the moment.
