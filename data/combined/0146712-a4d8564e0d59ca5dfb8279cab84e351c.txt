I’ve been keeping this back for a while as a Patreon Exclusive image, but since the day of the Summer Sun Celebration that heralds the start of buckcon is upon us, I figure it’s the perfect time to share this with a larger audience.

So, here it is; a piece depicting some of my own Gryphonic characters fromask-prof-smirk marching alongside some of the fine ponies from askbritannia in an uneasy alliance. Supplies of this print are extremely limited, as it’s intended as a BUCK exclusive, so if you want a copy, be sure to stop by the Alicorn Mafia stand in the Vendors Hall (tables 23B-25) early on!

Also, remember to check out my new art blog: bbsportfolio

Now I must return to my fretting over getting ready for the convention itself! See people there!
