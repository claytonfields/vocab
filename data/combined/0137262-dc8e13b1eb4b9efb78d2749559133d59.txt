Announcement!

After almost 10 years, I will be leaving Freaks 4U Gaming.

Thank you for all the opportunities. Thank you for all the support. Thank you for letting me become the "me" I always wanted to be.

I will never forget where we started and will always be proud to have been a part of the freaks-family.



Every end is followed by a new beginning. My new beginning will lead me to France where my childhood dream will come true. I am incredible happy to tell you that I will start working for Blizzard in their Europe HQ in Versailles this january.



I will take on the role of the Associate Esports Manager - but don't worry...this does not mean that I stop hosting or casting by any means. I will still work in front of the camera and will be involved in talent management amongst other things.

I can't wait to start this new chapter in my life...and hope to still have all of you by my side as I continue my little adventures in yet another country.
