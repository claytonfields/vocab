With 2015 heading towards being the hottest year on record, India and China will negotiate for a treaty to put a check on the rising temperature.

The two countries will formally move a proposal at the Bonn climate talks starting from Monday, proposing that rich nations should have pre-2020 emission reduction targets. India will also propose that rich nations give US$ 100 billion of public finance every year to fight climate change.

An 89-page draft was agreed on in Geneva earlier this year for the Paris climate summit and at Bonn, negotiators of 196 countries will try to bridge differences on several contentious issues, including finance, mitigation targets, adaptation and technology transfer.

An Indian climate negotiator said the task at Bonn would not be easy as most of the countries were not willing to budge from their stand. He added that as the Prime Minister had made it clear, India would be insisting on pre-2020 emission targets as part of the deal.

“Having post-2020 emission reduction targets has no meaning unless rich countries have emission reduction targets for 2020. Many countries have opted out of the Kyoto Protocol making it a non-effective instrument,” the official said.

The proposal is backed by China and a few other developing countries but may be resisted by the United States which has not given any emission reduction target for 2020.

The negotiations come at the time when several tropical countries, including India and Africa, are battling an intense heat wave.

The Geneva-based World Meteorological Organisation that monitors global weather conditions had predicted that 2015 could be the warmest year on record. The prediction is based on the hot weather conditions in various regions of the world in the first five months of 2015.

Climate scientists believe that the weather condition this year should be a warning to countries that they need to act now to fight climate change.
