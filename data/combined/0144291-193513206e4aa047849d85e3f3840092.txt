Sling TV, Dish Network’s OTT-TV service for cord-cutters, is expanding its Sports Extra pack with the addition of Outside Television.

Sports Extra, which costs $5 per month on top of Sling TV’s core $20 per month package, also features ESPNU, beIN Sports, The SEC Network, ESPNNews, ESPN Bases Loaded, ESPN Buzzer Beater and ESPN Goal Line and Univision Deportes.

The addition of the channel, which features shows about outdoor sports and extreme activities such as surfing, kayaking, BASE jumping and climbing, comes about seven months after Dish Network and Outside Television announced a carriage deal, which paved the way for the lifestyle sports network to be added to Dish’s premium Multi-Sport Pack.

As Sling TV adds Outdoor Television to Sports Extra, it’s shedding one as well – Universal Sports Network, which is shutting down.
