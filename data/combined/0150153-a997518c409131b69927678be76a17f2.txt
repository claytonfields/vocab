Kevin Huber, the Bengals punter who fractured his jaw after an illegal hit by a Steelers player Sunday night, has one young fan, apparently. This seven-year-old's dad tweeted out a photo of his son's letter of support to Huber.

Assuming Jimmy Kimmel isn't behind this, it's pretty adorable. If you want to read it in better type, here it is, transcribed:

Dear Kevin, I hope you feel better soon. I am mad at the Steelers because you are my #1 player. I am 7 years old and love the Bengals and Bearcats. I know you played for the Bearcats and Bengals and I love the teams. I hope that Steeler player loses his house and has to live in his car. Get well soon, Nicholas Andrew Johnson.

That's a little harsh, kid, but your intentions are in the right place.
