In an interview with a right-wing talk show Saturday, a New Hampshire Republican lawmaker argued that armed rebellion may be the “next step” for right-wing activists.

J.R. Hoell, a Tea Party-aligned state representative from Dunbarton, has been rallying conservative activists against a possible Senate candidacy by former Massachusetts senator Scott Brown. Hoell was promoting an anti-Brown rally, featuring an AR-15 raffle, cosponsored by Gun Owners of New Hampshire and the New Hampshire Firearms Coalition, when he asserted that violent revolution could be on the table.

Steve MacDonald: We’ve had a number of pro-Second Amendment rallies here in New Hampshire. A lot of people would show up with holstered revolvers or handguns, some people will have worn their rifles as well over their shoulders. Is it going to be that kind of a rally? Is that something that you are asking people to do or asking them not to?

JR Hoell: I’m never going to tell a person not to carry a firearm. I will recommend people carry firearms concealed, tactically it’s a better solution, doesn’t mean you have to be a target. In terms of messaging to the media, if you are carrying concealed versus having an AR-15 or an AR-10 over your back, it’s a lot easier to make the statement we’re not here to threaten anybody. We’re here standing on our soapbox, as opposed to standing with our ammo box in hand, to make a point politically. The message needs to get out that Scott Brown does not represent New Hampshire. If things continue the way they are, there may be a day or a time where firearms and ammo are necessary, happened in the Revolutionary War. I’d like to think we’re not there yet but as things continue to unravel, that may be the next step. Let’s stand on our soap box this time.
