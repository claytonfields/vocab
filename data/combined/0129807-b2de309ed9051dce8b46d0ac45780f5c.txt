Combine garlic, ginger, half the sliced onion, curry leaves, green chilli and tomato in a food processor and process to form a paste.

Heat oil in a large wok over high heat. Add paste and cook, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes or until slightly coloured. Add curry powder, tomato paste, cumin and soy sauce, and stir to combine. Add carrot, cabbage and remaining sliced onion, and cook for 1 minute or until vegetables are almost tender. Add roti and cook for 2 minutes or until warmed through and starting to colour. Push mixture to the side of the wok, add beaten egg and stir for 1 minute or until just set. Stir to combine then serve with lemon wedges, extra chilli and coriander.

Notes

â€¢ Curry leaves, Sri Lankan curry powder, roti canai and paratha are from Asian and Indian food shops and select greengrocers.
