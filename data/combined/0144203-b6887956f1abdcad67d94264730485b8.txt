Tottenham striker Harry Kane is unconcerned by the criticism he has received following a mixed start to the season and has vowed to "never" lose his confidence in front of goal.

Kane failed to find the net as Spurs suffered a shock 2-1 defeat to Monaco in midweek and missed a key chance to level the scores at Wembley.

The 23-year-old has scored just one goal in five appearances for Mauricio Pochettino's side this term, which has seen the England international's longevity questioned in some quarters.

But Kane, who scored the 50th goal of his Premier League career last weekend, is unmoved by such negativity and has vowed to stay focused ahead of Sunday's clash with Sunderland.

"People said that this time last year and I went on to win the Golden Boot and score 30-odd goals for club and country," he told the Mirror.

"People are going to talk - people will talk. It doesn't bother me. I'm fit, I'm ready to go.

"I'll be ready on Sunday, if called upon by the gaffer, and hopefully I can get on the scoresheet and win the game."

Confidence is key for any striker and even some of the best players are not alien to peaks and troughs in regards to goalscoring form.

However, Kane is adamant he will never doubt is own ability and is determined to put the missed chance against Monaco behind him by coming up with the goods this weekend.

"As a striker you've got to be confident. I will never lose my confidence in front of goal.

"I'll be there on Sunday, if I get a chance, shooting and making the keeper work.

"You've got to learn from it. I'll be working hard to try and put it right and hopefully score on Sunday," he added.
