Microsoft is adding a number of new emoji symbols for Windows 10, and one of them will offer a way to give other people the finger. For the first time, an operating system has officially added an emoji with one raised middle finger as a way of communicating with others. Putting edginess aside, there are some other notable changes too.

While emoji symbols have been around for a while, they have seen a surge of popularity in the last couple of years as mobile phone users have begun to incorporate them more in their text messages. Microsoft started incorporating emojis out of the box starting with Windows 8 in 2012 and added color support for Windows 8.1 in 2013. According to the Emojipedia website, there will be six color variations for the many emoji in Windows 10. It adds that another emoji look's like Mr. Spock's Vulcan Salute in Star Trek in Microsoft's new OS, similar to the one that was added by Apple in April's iOS emoji update.
