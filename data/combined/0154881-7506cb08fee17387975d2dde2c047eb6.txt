The Presidential Administration of Russia has held a meeting today dedicated to the blockchain technology and the perspective of its implementation.

The lawyer Artem Tolkachev, who was present at the meeting, told CoinFox that a working group will be created by the Institute of Internet Development to deal with “the problems of blockchain development in Russia, regulation and improvement of [business] climate in what concerns the implementation of the technology.”

The Internet-ombudsman Dmitry Marinichev suggested equating cryptocurrencies to private property by amending the Civil Code and adopt a law on the investment status of digital currency. According to him, the Department of Information Technologies of the City of Moscow “proposes the integration of the technology into the voting process,” as well as a number of other projects on this platform.

The deputy director at the Department of Information Technologies of the City of Moscow Andrey Belozerov told Rambler agency, referring to the fact that information recorded in blockchain cannot be tampered with:

“Moscow is ready to become a platform for application of the blockchain technology. And we have a project called “Active citizen” to suggest as a pilot: on the one hand, to test the technology and understand if it is efficient for solving this kind of problems; on the other hand, to dispel certain scepticism on the part of citizens.”
