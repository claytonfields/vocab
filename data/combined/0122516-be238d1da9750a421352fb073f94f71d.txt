New anime streaming service HIDIVE announced on Wednesday that it will stream the English dubs for the School-Live and Chivalry of a Failed Knight anime. Both series are currently available in Japanese with English subtitles in their entirety, and the service will add English-dubbed episodes in installments.

The first two episodes of School-Live! are now available and new episodes will launch on Tuesdays at 1:00 p.m. EDT. The first four episodes of Chivalry of a Failed Knight are available now and new episodes will launch on Mondays at 1:00 p.m. EDT.

HIDIVE launched its beta version on Tuesday. The streaming service has acquired assets from Anime Network Online, which will cease operations following a limited transition period for subscriber migration. The Anime Network, Inc. will continue to operate its cable television and subscription video on demand services.

HIDIVE currently offers an ad-supported free membership, but English dubs, exclusive titles, uncensored content, subtitle style options, and HD video are only available for subscribers. Membership will cost US$3.99 per month for a limited time as an introductory price, and a seven-day free trial is available. Subscribers can add up to two simultaneous streams for US$1 each.
