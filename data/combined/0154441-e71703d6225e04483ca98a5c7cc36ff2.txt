With any release, there are inevitably a number of issues waiting in the "feedback" state. That is, they are supposed to be fixed but we are waiting on feedback from users to determine if issues can really be closed. In some cases they may not be fixed, and we need additional information or confirmation.

These tickets can be seen here:

https://redmine.pfsense.org/projects/pfsense/issues?query_id=105

It helps speed up the development process if everyone goes through the list and tests a few of the tickets.

Please update to a current snapshot before testing!

If the issue is still not fixed, say so in the ticket and we can set it back to 'new' and work on it some more.

If the issue is fixed, say so in the ticket and we can mark it resolved it and move on.

If you see a ticket that already has feedback saying it is resolved, but the ticket is still open, let us know so it can be closed.

Any input is appreciated, thanks!
