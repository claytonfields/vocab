We're gonna let it burn, burn, burn!...

Britons are taking to social media to publicly reveal how they are disposing of Prime Minister David Cameron‚Äôs ¬£9 million pro-European Union (EU) propaganda leaflet which started landing on people‚Äôs doorsteps this morning.

While a parliamentary committee should consider the 200,000+ signature petition to stop the mass mailout going any further, those who have received the leaflet already have taking to tweeting and Facebooking about the multitude of ways in which they have disposed of the document.

Here are some of the best:
