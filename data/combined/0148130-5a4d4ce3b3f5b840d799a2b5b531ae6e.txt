Sony is bringing back Crash Bandicoot, says NECA director of product development [Update]

"I see they're bringing Crash Bandicoot back."

Update: A representative for NECA told GameSpot that the comment was made in error.

“It’s not the case,” the rep said. “Someone has misunderstood a comment he made. Randy saw a faked fan-made image right before he came to the show and said that if the game were coming back, we’d love to do figures.”

The image in question is likely this, which has been making the rounds online.

Original: Randy Falk, director of product development at National Entertainment Collectibles Association (NECA)—a company that works with Sony on collectible figures—said that Sony is bringing back Crash Bandicoot during an interview at Toy Fair 2016, which began yesterday in New York City.

Speaking to Pixel Dan, Falk said, “On the modern gaming front, we’re going strong. We’ve got a lot of cool stuff going on with Sony. So we have Ultimate Kratos from God of War III that’s about to hit retail. We have Uncharted 4 Nathan Drake, which comes out in May. And then LittleBigPlanet is doing really well, so we have some more of those here on display, too.”

After Dan compliments the Kratos figure, Falk continues: “Yeah, that’s one we wanted to do way back when, and finally, we’ve been able to get back in with Sony and get some of that stuff out. And looking at some of their other titles, I see they’re bringing Crash Bandicoot back, which is really cool. There’s some great stuff there.”

Far too many signs have pointed to Sony somehow resurrecting the Crash Bandicoot series. In brief:
