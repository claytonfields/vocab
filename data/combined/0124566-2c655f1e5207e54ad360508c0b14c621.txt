PESHAWAR, Pakistan â€” Two senior Pakistani militants who had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State were among at least 24 people killed in an American drone strike in eastern Afghanistan on Monday, Pakistani and Afghan security officials said Thursday.

Afghan officials described one of the men, Gul Zaman, as the deputy leader of the Islamic State in Afghanistan. The other commander, Shahidullah Shahid, had been the main spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban until he joined Islamic State last year.

Though officials do not yet consider the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, to be a major threat in either Pakistan or Afghanistan, the group has drawn increased support from disaffected Taliban militants on both sides of the border over the past year.

A senior Pakistani official in Peshawar said both men had been killed alongside several other militants in an American drone strike in Nangarhar Province, in eastern Afghanistan, on Monday. The official said the drone strike had targeted a leadership council meeting of the so-called Islamic State in Khorasan, an old term that includes Pakistan and Afghanistan.
