Earlier today we brought you word that one LSU offensive lineman would be (controversially) returning to the Tigers. Now there’s word of a loss at the same position group.

The university has confirmed that Jonah Austin (pictured, No. 71) has decided to take his leave of the football program and transfer to an undetermined location. No reason for the decision to leave was given, although a search for a better opportunity at playing time would be a good place to start.

If Austin were to end up at another FBS institution, he’d be eligible to play in 2015 as a graduate transfer.

Austin was a three-star member of LSU’s 2011 recruiting class who was rated as the No. 58 tackle in the country. He did not see any game action his first two seasons in Baton Rouge, then played in a total of 12 games the past two years — five in 2014, seven in 2013.

As was the case each of the past two seasons, the 6-6, 330-pound Austin was slated for a backup role in 2015.
