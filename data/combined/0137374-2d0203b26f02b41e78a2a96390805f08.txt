Kanye West is headed back to the United States for the first time since February. The G.O.O.D. Music rapper/producer will be leaving his Parisian confines to make an appearance as the musical guest on the May 18th episode of Saturday Night Live.

Page Six reports:

Kanye West is due back in the States next month, Page Six has exclusively learned, but it’s not necessarily to rush to the side of his very pregnant reality star girlfriend, Kim Kardashian. Sources tell us the rapper — who’s been working on a new album in France — will appear as musical guest on “SNL” on May 18. West’s been holed up in a palatial pad ever since Paris fashion week in February, leaving his baby mama alone to brave pregnancy and public scrutiny over her weight, maternity fashions and upcoming divorce trial with Kris Humphries. Sources tell us the rapper’s even pondering a permanent move to Paris. An NBC rep would only say the show hasn’t announced its lineup.

The most recent rapper to perform on SNL was Kendrick Lamar back in January, but Jay-Z did make an appearance when Justin Timberlake was the musical guest, and host, in March. Miguel is the latest artist to grace the SNL stage doing so this past weekend.

This isn’t the first time Yeezy has appeared on SNL. In 2010, he wooed the crowd to some of his My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy cuts.
