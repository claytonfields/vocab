A motorcyclist suffered fatal injuries after a high-speed collision early this afternoon south of downtown.

At approximately 1:00 p.m. officers responded to East Marginal Way South and South Spokane Street for reports of a vehicle/motorcycle collision with injuries. Preliminary investigation indicates that a 24-year-old man was driving his white Yamaha motorcycle southbound on East Marginal Way South at a high rate of speed and passing vehicles using the bicycle lane. As the motorcyclist approached South Spokane Street he struck a green Isuzu Trooper SUV that had been travelling southbound on East Marginal Way South and was initiating a westbound turn onto South Spokane Street. The force of the collision caused the motorcyclist to be thrown from his motorcycle, and he subsequently sustained fatal injures.

Fire department medics responded and pronounced the motorcyclist deceased at the scene. King County Medical Examinerâ€™s Office personnel responded and took custody of the deceased man.

The 50-year-old driver of the Isuzu was transported to Harborview Medical Center via ambulance for precautionary reasons. Officers evaluated the driver of the Isuzu for signs of impairment; none were detected.

Traffic Collision Investigation Squad detectives responded to the scene and continue to actively investigate.
