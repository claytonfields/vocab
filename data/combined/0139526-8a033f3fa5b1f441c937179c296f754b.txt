It is becoming an epidemic of the Olympic Games. Following the withdrawls of Steven Stamkos, and Marian Gaborik, another high-profile Olympian has pulled out of the games with Swedish centre and Vancouver Canuck Henrik Sedin the latest to announce that he will not be going to Sochi. Sedin is out with bruised ribs suffered in a January 17th game against the Phoenix Coyotes when he was cross-checked by Martin Hanzal.

Sedin missed six games with the injury, before returning to the Canucks lineup for two games early this week. However he was ineffective in the two contests, and feels that he is not ready to play in the Olympic competition. Sedin will also sit out the Canucks next two games against the Montreal Canadiens (tonight) and Toronto Maple Leafs (Saturday).

In 52 games this season, the 33-year-old Sedin has nine goals and 31 assists for 40 points.

Team Sweden first sees action in Sochi on February 12 when they meet the Czech Republic. The have not yet officially named a replacement for Henrik Sedin, though there is already a ton of speculation that the replacement will be Mikael Backlund of the Calgary Flames.
