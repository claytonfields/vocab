This is the terrifying moment a huge tyre from a lorry gets blasted up in the air and falls back to earth to destroy a car because bungling workers started inflating it and forgot about it.

The shocking incident took place in the Vakhrushev car depot in the town of Kiselyovsk in south-central Russia.

It is reported that employees of the car depot in charge of inflating the wheel got distracted.

As a result of their mistake the huge three-tonne wheel exploded from over-inflation and was catapulted into the air.

After hitting a wall on its descent the giant wheel went on to demolish a Toyota Corolla car that was parked nearby.

The car belonged to a female accountant of the car depot and was written off in the accident.
