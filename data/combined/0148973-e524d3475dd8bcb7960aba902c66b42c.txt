My name is Gregor Klingman and I am the creator of the Wild Reign Playing Cards. For the last year, I have tirelessly crafted the designs and details of these cards in my spare time, all while supporting my family and working full time. It's been a dream of mine to create something fun and unique that I could share with the world. This was the perfect project for me to bring together two of my favorite things: playing cards and animals.

I wanted to create a visually striking and detailed deck of cards that could easily replace anyone's home or casino deck. This 54-card poker deck is 100% practical for playing, and has a classic feel. With single colors and no shading, they will not detract from your gaming.

There are many subtle patterns in the deck (clothing, symbols, weapons, etc.). Each card shares similarities with its counterpart suits and ranks, yet each face card has small variations from one side to the other (as you can see in the pictures below).

Each suit has its own personality. I wanted to draw the player in to establish a personal connection with each suit and card, which is something I've felt was missing from classic playing cards. I used a wide variety of animals that I felt matched each suit's personality, and each card feels like a character in a story.

After studying the different animals, I started by drawing each card in pencil, then went over the pencils with various Faber-Castell pens. I used the same method on each card to keep a consistent look throughout the deck. Next, I scanned the pens into Illustrator and added colors and textures to give the cards added depth. Each card has at least three different subtle texture layers.

The 54 poker-sized playing cards will be printed by the USPCC (the United States Playing Card Company).

8" x 10" High Quality Art Prints will be printed on a traditional thick Solar White Classic Crest paper stock.

The cards were drawn and enhanced at large sizes and include many details that you won't see at a traditional playing card size. The 8" x 10" prints are the perfect way to appreciate and display your favorite cards.

The Art Prints will be shipped flat and secure. (Frames not included)

The incredible funding that this project has received has made for new possibilities. If a funding total of $9000 is reached, I will be able to afford to have all the Wild Reign Playing Cards printed by USPCC (United States Playing Card Company), the world's leading standard in playing card printing. They manufacture Bicycle, Bee, Aviator, Hoyle, and many other card companies that most people are familiar with. Their quality is unmatched and provide the best play-ability for casinos, cardists, and magicians.
