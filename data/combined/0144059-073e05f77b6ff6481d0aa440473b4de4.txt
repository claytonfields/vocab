The government of Ontario has assembled a nominating committee to recommend potential board members for the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan Administration Corporation.

The chair of the committee will be Ellen Mercier who currently chairs the Canadian Payments Association and was chair of the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan from 2007 to 2014.

The other two appointees are Carol Hansell, a governance expert and the founding partner of Hansell LLP, and Susan Wolburgh Jenah, the current chair of the initial board of directors of the ORPP AC.

The province chose the members based on their backgrounds, skill sets and experience in corporate governance and pension administration.

“The establishment of the nominating committee marks an important milestone in our plan to expand pension coverage to over four million Ontario workers,” said Mitzie Hunter, the minister in charge of the ORPP.

“This highly accomplished committee will ensure that the very best talent is recruited to the ORPP AC board, supporting successful implementation of the ORPP and the effective governance of the corporation.”
