Alvaro Morata followed up his goal for Juventus on Saturday with a "deal with it" celebration.

The Spaniard's shot went in after a mess of a save from Samir Handanovic:





The Inter Milan goalkeeper is definitely going to have to deal with it—Juventus sealed the victory 2-1.





Update: May 20

The fan who owned the sunglasses has been speaking to the Italian media about the incident and admits he was annoyed Morata wore them.

The 27-year-old named Simone spoke to La Gazzetta dello Sport, per Football Italia:

For a huge Inter fan like me, it really wasn’t fun to see a Juve player put them on. I was very angry at conceding the goal, as it completed the comeback and was basically a fluke from Samir Handanovic’s mistake. Morata came to celebrate underneath the Curva where I was. I had my sunglasses in my hand, was agitated at the situation and they flew out of my hand. When I saw Bonucci pick them up and hand them to his team-mate, I tried to call out to them, but they didn’t hear me. After the celebration Morata threw them to the side of the pitch and who knows where they ended up. I haven’t seen them again. Fortunately, I only paid €2 for them at a market stall… It was an accident and I certainly didn’t intentionally throw them.
