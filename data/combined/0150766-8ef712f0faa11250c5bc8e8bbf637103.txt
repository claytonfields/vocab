RELEASE DATE: February 6, 2018

Sony Pictures Home Entertainment presents the Blu-ray & DVD for Jesse V. Johnson’s Accident Man (read our review). Martial arts sensation Scott Adkins (Close Range, Zero Tolerance, Hard Target 2, Savage Dog) stars in this film adaptation of Mills and Tony Skinner’s out-of-print UK comic Toxic!

Mike Fallon is the Accident Man – a stone cold killer and the best at what he does. But when a loved one is dragged into the London underworld and murdered by his own crew, Fallon (Adkins) is forced to rip apart the life he knew in order to avenge the one person who actually meant something to him.

Accident Man also stars Ray Stevenson (Punisher: War Zone), Ashley Greene (Twilight), David Paymer (Drag Me to Hell), Amy Johnston (Female Fight Squad), Ray Park (G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra) and Michael Jai White (Falcon Rising).

Accident Man will mark the third time Adkins and Johnson are partnering up for a production (Adkins had a role in 2005’s Pit Fighter).
