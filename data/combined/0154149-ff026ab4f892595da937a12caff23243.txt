Earlier on Wednesday, reports were circulating that linked Chelsea and United States center back, Matt Miazga, with a loan move to Bundesliga side Eintracht Frankfurt.

Soon after the news hit, Frankfurt’s sporting director, Fredi Bobic, came out and denied that the club had interest in the New Jersey native.

According to Frankfurter Neue Presse, Bobic stated in a press conference that Miazga was “not an option” for them at this time.

Could he just be playing a hardball negotiating tactic at this point? Who knows with clubs these days. Some are truthful in their denials and some are just bitter that information has leaked out into the media.

It seems almost a certainty at this point that Miazga will be loaned out before the summer transfer window closes. If Bobic’s comments are truthful, then Chelsea will have to find another loan destination for the 21-year-old.

Perhaps it’s an good omen to keep a USMNT center back away from Timmy Chandler in the Bundesliga. Omar Gonzalez was the last one to be paired up with the German-American and he ended up with a torn knee ligament after one training session while on loan with FC Nuremburg in 2012 (This is completely a joke, but the irony is kind of weird).

Stay tuned to the wild and wacky transfer season loan saga as it unfolds. We’ll keep you updated.
