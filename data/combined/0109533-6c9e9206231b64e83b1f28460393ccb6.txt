CARLTON'S Dylan Buckley has taken a giant step outside his father's shadow by being named the NAB AFL Rising Star nominee for round two.The son of Jim – a member of the Blues' Hall of Fame and a three-time premiership player - was one of Carlton's best in a 12-point loss to Richmond at the MCG last Thursday night.Buckley collected 18 disposals - including six contested - and used the ball at better than 94 per cent efficiency on a night when many of his teammates were wasteful, particularly in front of goal.The 21-year-old's performance across half-back was even more impressive given he was originally an emergency and only called into the 22 late on the day of his second AFL game.Buckley said he was stunned to be named this week's Rising Star."I was just pretty excited and pretty rapt. It didn't really even cross my mind," he told"To be nominated is obviously a huge honour and something that I never thought that I would be able to do."Buckley, who stands 179cm tall and looks as though he could be knocked over by a gentle breeze, made an immediate impression on his debut in round three last year against Geelong.Substituted on to the field in the second term, he snapped a brilliant left-foot goal on the run after just 18 seconds on the park.But that loss against the Cats would be the speedster's only senior appearance for the year.Buckley went back and played 15 VFL games before he injured his left shoulder and went under the surgeon's knife late in the season.The long wait between his debut and second match – and the fact he was overlooked in round one by coach Mick Malthouse after a strong pre-season – drove him to grab his chance against the Tigers with both hands."I was disappointed not to get a game (in round one), but that's footy and I just had to go back and play in the VFL and put my case forward," he said."Getting the call-up a week later I was just rapt and I suppose it did play a part in just trying to perform and keep my spot."Buckley credits Malthouse – and his mentors Kade Simpson and Heath Scotland - for developing the defensive side of his game."My first couple of years I played as a small forward and really struggled to play four quarters," Buckley said."I've just really found that I'm learning a lot now at half-back and it suits my sort of game just playing down there."I couldn't speak highly enough of Mick, he's been really good for me."I've had a lot of help from Kade Simpson and Heath Scotland. They're both terrific."I couldn't be learning from anyone better and they've been huge helps for my development."It means Jim Buckley has happily taken a back seat since his son has progressed from the Northern Knights into the AFL."He's always there if I need anything. If I have a good game he won't say too much, but if I struggle he'll let me know what I've done wrong," laughed Buckley, who was a father-son selection at pick No.62 overall in the 2011 NAB AFL Draft."It's a dream come true to play for Carlton. With dad playing at the club I've been around here for a while ... to put the jumper on means so much."I just want to be my own player, I don't want to be known as Jim Buckley's son."The round two Rising Star nomination - which sees Buckley become the first Carlton player to be nominated since Jeff Garlett in round 19, 2010 – suggests he's on the right track.
