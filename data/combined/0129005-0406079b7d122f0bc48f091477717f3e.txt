The Islanders opened with four straight wins for just the third time in franchise history, and that momentum to begin their last season at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum — despite their first loss, at Pittsburgh on Saturday — made Brett Yormark happy.

Yormark, the chief executive of the Nets and Barclays Center, the Islanders’ new home starting next fall, could not ask for better timing to embark on an extensive marketing plan to attract new fans in Brooklyn.

On Monday, Barclays Center will begin a “Brooklyn Scores” campaign through direct mail, social media, cable television commercials and print advertising to persuade potential fans in the city’s most populous borough to try live hockey next season. About 20,000 direct mailers — 75 percent in Brooklyn, with the rest in Manhattan and Queens — will be sent out periodically over the next four months, with an emphasis on season-ticket sales.

This campaign is not specifically aimed at fans in Nassau and Suffolk counties, but Yormark was careful to acknowledge that Long Island fans, who have supported the Islanders since 1972, would not be lost in the move.
