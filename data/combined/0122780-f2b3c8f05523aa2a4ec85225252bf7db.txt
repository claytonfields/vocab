With the pathetic Knicks in town, the Wizards wisely determined that Paul Pierce’s services would not be needed. The 37-year-old small forward sat on the bench while Washington trounced New York, but his attendance at the game hardly went unnoticed.

That’s because Pierce took advantage of not having to wear his uniform, and showed the world that he is really big into glasses. Or to put it another way, he is into really big glasses.

Pierce may have been paying homage to Run-DMC by wearing Cazals — or perhaps their cheapo knockoffs, Gazelles — but Internet denizens took great delight in comparing the Wizard to a host of bespectacled characters.
