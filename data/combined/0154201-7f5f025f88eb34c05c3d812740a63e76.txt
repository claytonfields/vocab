The swooning euro represents the latest worry for investors ahead of the new year. Rumors of a euro zone sovereign nation getting downgraded and a disappointing Italian bond auction have been this week’s catalysts for the common currency dropping to its lowest level against the dollar since September 2010.

For stocks, the Dow industrials dropped 140 points yesterday, the worst selloff in about two weeks. But Dow today has clawed back more than half of that decline and was recently up 78 points.

Heading into 2012, Gartman describes how Europe has arrived at its own “Lehman moment.” That won’t bode well for anyone come the new year. For Gartman’s analysis, read more after the break:
