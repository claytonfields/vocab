Sessions & Tracks

Scaffolds

Scaffolds are one of the three most important essentials constituting the basic concept of Regenerative Medicine, and are included in the core technology of Regenerative Medicine. Every day thousands of surgical procedures are done to replace or repair tissue that has been damaged through disease or trauma. The developing field of tissue engineering (TE) aims to regenerate damaged tissues by combining cells from the body with highly porous scaffold biomaterials, which act as templates for tissue regeneration, to guide the growth of new tissue. Scaffolds has a prominent role in tissue regeneration the designs, fabrication, 3D models, surface ligands and molecular architecture, nanoparticle-cell interactions and porous of the scaffolds are been used in the field in attempts to regenerate different tissues and organs in the body. The world stem cell market was approximately 2.715 billion dollars in 2010, and with a growth rate of 16.8% annually, a market of 6.877 billion dollars will be formed in 2016. From 2017, the expected annual growth rate is 10.6%, which would expand the market to 11.38 billion dollars by 2021.

Cord Blood Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine

Recently, cord blood stems cells are developed in the treatment of different diseases, including a broad range of cancers, blood disorders, and genetic diseases. In a cord blood transplant, stem cells are infused in to a patient’s bloodstream for healing and repairing damaged cells and tissue. In a successful transplant, new healthy immune system has been created. The natural power and purity of newborn's cord blood are responsible for healthy development during gestation. Cord blood applications have developed beyond transplant medicine into the areas of regenerative medicine including brain injuries, autism, Cardiac Problems, and Autoimmune Deficiencies. The latest research in routine transplantation of cord blood are reviewed followed by the critical role of cord blood stem cells in regenerative medicine research and novel approaches using cord blood as a source of whole blood for transfusion.

Regeneration & Therapeutics

Some parts of our bodies can repair themselves quite well after injury, but others don’t repair at all. We certainly can’t regrow a whole leg or arm, but some animals can regrow - or regenerate - whole body parts. Regeneration means the regrowth of a damaged or missing organ part from the remaining tissue. As adults, humans can regenerate some organs, such as the liver. If part of the liver is lost by disease or injury, the liver grows back to its original size, though not its original shape. And our skin is constantly being renewed and repaired. Unfortunately many other human tissues don’t regenerate, and a goal in regenerative medicine is to find ways to kick-start tissue regeneration in the body, or to engineer replacement tissues.

Rejuvenation

Rejuvenation is a medical discipline focused on the practical reversal of the aging process. Rejuvenation is distinct from life extension. Life extension strategies often study the causes of aging and try to oppose those causes in order to slow aging. Rejuvenation is the reversal of aging and thus requires a different strategy, namely repair of the damage that is associated with aging or replacement of damaged tissue with new tissue. Rejuvenation can be a means of life extension, but most life extension strategies do not involve rejuvenation.

Immunotherapy

Immunotherapy, also called biologic treatment, is a kind of disease treatment that lifts the body's common guards to battle the malignancy. It utilizes substances made by the body or in a research facility to enhance or re-establish safe framework work. Immunotherapy may work in these ways: Halting or abating the development of tumor cells, preventing malignancy from spreading to different parts of the body, helping the safe framework work better at crushing disease cells. There are several types of immunotherapy, including: Monoclonal antibodies, Non-specific immunotherapies, oncolytic virus therapy, T-cell therapy, Cancer vaccines

Stem cell treatment for Diabetes

Insulin is a very important hormone that is produced by the pancreas and helps to keep the body’s blood sugar (glucose) levels in check. Diabetes is caused when there is an imbalance of insulin in the body. Type 1 Diabetes: This is usually diagnosed during childhood where the body makes very little or no insulin. In conventional therapy, there is only a way to maintain the right levels of insulin with daily injections. Type 2 Diabetes: In this condition, the body becomes resistive to insulin and the pancreas loses the capability to make enough insulin which is required to keep blood glucose levels normal. This is usually because of incorrect diet, lack or exercise or being overweight. Most diabetics suffer from Type 2 Diabetes.

Biochips & Tissue chips

Biochips refer to the complete fundamental functional unit, capable of performing multi biochemical tasks simultaneously. Tissue chips on the other hand are similar miniaturized units that can replace a tissue or some part of it, enabling the organ to work normally. Both biochips & tissue chips have been elemental in tissue engineering technology and have proven to be of utmost importance in the same arena. DNA microarray also called as biochip in simple terms consists of a two dimensional grid system where upon sensors or solid flat substrates are incorporated. These solid substrates can be either positively charged just like silicon or glass or can also be consisting of integrated circuitry units that perform best in signal transduction studies.

Cancer Stem Cells

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are cancer cells (found within tumors or hematological cancers) that possess characteristics associated with normal stem cells, specifically the ability to give rise to all cell types found in a particular cancer sample. CSCs are therefore tumorigenic (tumor-forming), perhaps in contrast to other non-tumorigenic cancer cells. CSCs may generate tumors through the stem cell processes of self-renewal and differentiation into multiple cell types. Such cells are hypothesized to persist in tumors as a distinct population and cause relapse and metastasis by giving rise to new tumors. Therefore, development of specific therapies targeted at CSCs holds hope for improvement of survival and quality of life of cancer patients, especially for patients with metastatic disease.

Chemotherapy

Chemotherapy is a widely used treatment for cancer. It usually entails the use of chemicals to destroy cancer cells on a selective basis. As part of the body's natural process, cells are constantly replaced through a process of dividing and growing. When cancer occurs, cells reproduce in an uncontrolled manner. More and more cells are produced, and they start to occupy an increasing amount of space until they occupy the space previously inhabited by useful cells. It usually is used to treat patients with cancer that has spread from the place in the body where it metastasized. Chemotherapy destroys cancer cells anywhere in the body. It even kills cells that have broken off from the main tumor & travel through the blood or lymph systems to the other parts of the body.

Chemotherapy drugs: Impair mitosis, or prevent cell division, as in the case of cytotoxic drugs. Target the cancer cells' food source, which consists of the enzymes and hormones they need to grow. Apoptosis stop the growth of new blood vessels that supply a tumor in order to starve it. A single drug or a combination of drugs is used. These can be delivered either directly into the bloodstream, to attack cancer cells throughout the body, or they can be targeted to specific cancer sites.
