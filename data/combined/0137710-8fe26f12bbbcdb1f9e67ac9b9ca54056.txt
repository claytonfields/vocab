Former Ambassador for Pacific Economic Development Shane Jones has let loose on the Government's immigration policy, slamming it as "conceited".

The former Labour MP has dropped hints he's planning a return to politics, this time with New Zealand First.

Newshub spoke to him on Thursday following the release of a Newshub-Reid Research poll showing the Labour party's popularity is plummeting.

In response, Mr Jones slammed the current Government's immigration policy.

"The Government's become conceited, it's got an unhinged immigration policy, international education is now synonymous with butter chicken - rancid," he said.

Mr Jones was stripped of his portfolios in 2010 after it emerged he used his taxpayer-funded credit card to hire pornographic films while away on ministerial business.

He stepped down as a Labour MP in 2014.
