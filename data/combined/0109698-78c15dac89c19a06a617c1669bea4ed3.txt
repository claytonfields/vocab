ANN ARBOR, Mich. -- Michigan Wolverines sophomore receiver Amara Darboh will miss the 2013 season with a foot injury that will require him to have surgery, according to a news release.

Darboh, who played mostly on special teams as a freshman, had been lauded for his play during Michigan's spring and fall camps, when he became a consistent target for quarterback Devin Gardner.

"I love Amara, and just hate it for him, how hard he worked through the offseason and fall camp to earn a starting role," Michigan coach Brady Hoke said in the release. "We'll rally around him like a family does and help him get through this difficult time."

On Tuesday -- before the severity of Darboh's injury was revealed -- senior receiver Joe Reynolds said that senior Jeremy Gallon had stepped up his play during Darboh's absence, as had redshirt freshman Jehu Chesson.
