A man accused of robbing two men as they ate at a Logan Circle pizza shop has pleaded guilty and now faces up to 30 years in prison.

WASHINGTON – A man accused of robbing two men as they ate at a D.C. pizza shop has pleaded guilty.

The U.S. Attorney’s office says James E. Wade, 30 of D.C., pleaded guilty to an armed robbery charge in court Friday.

A sentencing hearing is set for Nov. 7. He faces up to 30 years in prison.

Surveillance cameras at Pizzoli’s Pizzeria on 12th Street in Logan Circle captured the armed robbery. Police released the video and received numerous calls identifying the robber as Wade, the attorney’s office says.

Two men were eating on the outdoor patio in front of the restaurant when a man approached them about 9:20 p.m. on May 17. He demanded money from the men at gunpoint and they turned over their cash, wallets and cellphones. Wade took the money and property and left, according to the attorney’s office and police reports.

D.C. police arrested Wade for the robbery in June, several days after the surveillance video was publicly released.
