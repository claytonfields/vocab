ORLANDO, Fla. - Three women were arrested Monday in a prostitution bust at a massage parlor, Orlando police said.

The Metropolitan Bureau of Investigation issued arrest warrants for three women after receiving several complaints on Crimeline that the defendants were engaging in prostitution at Bora Bora Massage and Spa, according to court records.

An MBI undercover agent went to the spa on Woodward Street in Orlando on Feb. 2. The agent paid $60 for a 30-minute massage. During the massage, the woman offered him a "full service" for $140, according to the arrest warrant.

"Full service" is common street terminology for sex, according to the MBI.

Tipsters who called Crimeline said the employees were "scantily clad," with clothing barely covering their breasts and buttocks.

Agents found users on a website mostly used by men seeking commercial sex providers discussing their experiences at Bora Bora, according to MBI.

Changhui Lei and Morakot Goh were booked into the Orange County Jail and charged with unlicensed practice of a health care profession, offering to engage in prostitution, failure to cover customer's anatomical areas and several other crimes.

Lillian Doh was arrested on a charge of probable cause.

Lei and Goh have bonded out of jail. Their bonds were set at $14,000 and $12,000, respectively.
