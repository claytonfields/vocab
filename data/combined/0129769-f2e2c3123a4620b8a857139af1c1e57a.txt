This was a homework assignment for art class.

The theme was "pears/pairs" and that was subject to interpretation.

Well I suppose I wanted to do a pear tree but decided deer antlers serve as better branches.

Long story short, that is XD

(I noticed that mostly after finishing it *facepalms*) So a pair of pears dangling from a pair of antlers.. eh? Anyone?(I noticed that mostly after finishing it *facepalms*)





I was going to add leaves but I didn't want to take away from the image. The ink dropping was too fun to do.





I like how this turned out I'd think! I can't say for sure. I like it but I'm not sure what I've created XD
