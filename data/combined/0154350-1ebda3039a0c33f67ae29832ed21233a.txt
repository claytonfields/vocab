What Makes a Good PC Gaming Chair? Ergonomics

We’re pc gaming chair gurus too

Whether you’re a casual gamer who plays for a few hours on the weekend or an aspiring professional, every PC gamer needs a gaming chair.

Buying a gaming chair is not something that should be taken lightly. I encourage you to do your research and test as many chairs as you can before making a purchase.

That being said, you should know the features you should put before others and what’s available on the market. To help you, I’ve created a brief guide on PC gaming chairs and the importance of ergonomics in gaming chairs.

Let’s get to it.

PC Gaming Chair vs. Console Chairs

As video games have become more extensive, the variety of chairs available to gamers has expanded. Of course, today we’re focusing on PC gaming chairs, but I wanted to point out the common differences between those and console chairs.

PC gaming chairs

As their name implies, these chairs are made specifically for PC gaming. They have an upright position, arm rests, head rests, and race car seat appearance.

Not all PC chairs look like they’ve been ripped out of a stock car, but you’ll find plenty that looks like this.

PC gaming chairs also characteristically have several fine-tuned adjustments you can make to the chair, including back angle, seat slope, height, and depth.

You can find our Best PC Gaming Chairs list here.

Console chairs

These chairs typically come in a rocker style and are either on the ground or mounted on a pedestal. They’ll often come with many bells and whistles, including built-in speakers, wireless receivers, and headphone jacks.

Select Your Specs

As I mentioned, there will be plenty of chair specs you’ll need to decide on when you buy a new gaming chair.

Comfort

If you’re planning on spending a lot of time playing games, comfort should be your primary concern. Armrests, head rests, back support, padding, and other fine-tuned adjustments all contribute to how comfortable a chair is.

Size

While most chairs are built for the average person, there are chairs available for bigger or taller people, too. Going back to the comfort factor, ensure you feel comfortable and supported in the chair you choose.

Materials

The type of materials in a chair often reflect its quality and durability. A frame made of steel will last longer than one of plastic. You’ll also have to choose between leather or cloth for the exterior, which is based on personal preference more than anything.

Price

One of the trickiest aspects of finding a gaming chair is finding the best value for the best price. It’s even harder to write about because everyone has their particulars about their gaming chair. I believe you find the best deal when you strike a balance between comfort, support, and durability.

The majority of PC gaming chairs fall in the $170 to $400 price range, but you can find chairs that sell for upwards of $1,000.

The Importance of Ergonomics

Chances are if you have an overly-concerned mother or ever-complaining coworker, you’ve heard about ergonomics and the importance of having an ergonomic gaming, studying, or office setup.

By definition, ergonomics is the study of the human use of objects and how to make them easy and safe to use. Ergonomics often is thrown around in the workplace as studies have shown the use of computers and office seating can cause repetitive stress injuries.

Having an ergonomic setup should extend beyond the office into any setting in which you are sitting in one position or using a particular apparatus, like a computer mouse, for long periods of time. Hopefully, by this point you’ve realized your gaming setup should also provide ergonomic benefits, starting with your chair.

If you’re not concerned with ergonomics, you should be.

Over the past few years, researchers published their studies on gamers and musculoskeletal problems. Each study reported over 50% of the subjects reported discomfort in their backs, necks, arms, or hands/wrists, with some studies reporting as high as 65%.

A good PC gaming chair will provide good lumbar support, head and neck support, and will encourage blood flow in the lower part of the body. This is particularly important if you like games where you need to grind for hours.

Also, make sure your desk is compatible with your new chair. You can find our guide to computer desks here.

Why Racing Chairs Aren’t All They’re Cracked Up to Be

As I mentioned before, many PC gaming chairs look as if they’ve been ripped out of a race car.

No one’s sure why this happened in the first place, but many speculate it was a marketing tactic to sell chairs that gave players an edge over others.

The thing about these chairs is they’re bad at supporting a gamer’s lower back, which, of course, was prone to happen, given race car seats are designed to keep a driver as safe as possible.

You’ll see many manufacturers of these chairs have started including small cushions with the seats to provide lower back support. Sometimes this suffices, and other times it doesn’t. Ultimately, it’s up to you to determine how much support you’ll need in a chair.

The “Repurposed” Office Chair

I say “repurposed” because office chair manufacturers aren’t out there advertising their chairs as gaming chairs, but frequently they do make awesome gaming chairs.

The reason for this is many office chair manufacturers have already begun to address the issue of back stress in the workplace. They’ve figured out how to provide the most back support while encouraging blood circulation in the legs.

Due to many office chairs’ ergonomic efficiencies, I encourage you to also look at office chairs during your hunt for a gaming chair.

Start Hunting!

If you take anything away from this article, let it be this: find a PC gaming chair that supports your back and head, especially if you’re known to game for hours on end.

Other key takeaways:

Try to find the best mix of price and value.

Racing seats look cool but won’t always feel cool after 6 hours of gameplay.

Don’t discount the office chair.
