So one of the first things I did yesterday was delete my blog post from the day before and it seems to be irretrievable. I've messaged the site admin, hopefully they can get that back.

I've been continuing to use TwitterDeck trying and drum up some support for Monsteca but I can see that Twitter it's more of long game. I've signed up to unfollowers.com which gave me a nice insight into the activity of followers and following however the real power of this application is in the subscription version. Nice video tutorial on Unfollows.com can be found here

Searching out suitable subreddits for posting my blog and game updates has proved tricky, I've been shot down in two sub-reddits for spamming :S Trying not to be spammy is a little difficult, so I'll be focusing on trying to give a little more in content next week.

I'm pleased with how my article was picked up with over 400 visits in a day. This helped to boost the Monsteca in popularity on Indie DB up to 19th at the end of yesterday. The disappointing thing about this week is that very little of the traffic generated to this site has transferred to the Greenlight page on steam. The other disappointing thing is the lack of interactions on-line from player or devs.

So in summery, new channels must be searched out to connect with players and new content must be created in order to bring in interest and not be a spammer.
