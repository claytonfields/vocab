Cousins has missed the last three games -- all losses -- with the illness. The team said Wednesday that Cousins will not be in uniform when Sacramento hosts Indiana on Friday and Orlando on Saturday.

The Kings said Cousins underwent additional evaluation Tuesday evening. The team added that Cousins is improving daily and he is expected to make a full recovery and rejoin the team next week.

Cousins is averaging career highs of 23.5 points, 12.6 rebounds and 1.5 blocks. Sacramento has lost four straight after a surprising 9-5 start this season.
