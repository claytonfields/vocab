Japanese manga mega-magazine Weekly Shonen Jump has been host to many iconic faces of Japanese pop-culture in the decades it’s been in publication. From Dragonball, to Naruto, and One Piece, it’s put out enough acclaimed graphic novel series to give Marvel and DC a run for their money. Now the stars of Shonen Jump are brawling against each other, and they’re finally taking the battle to the West with crossover fighting game J-Stars Victory VS+. Previous meetings of Jump franchises were exclusive to the Far East, notably the Nintendo DS’ Jump Super Stars and Jump Ultimate Stars.

Thankfully Bandai Namco are bringing J-Stars over to North America and Europe this Summer, available on all three current PlayStation platforms (PS4, PS3, and Vita). Bamco have launched a Western site and several trailers that showcase the characters and manga series being represented in the game. The first of these features Goku and his nemesis Frieza of Dragonball Z fame. The next has characters that will be a lot less familiar to the audience – the heroes of Beelzebub and Chinyuki. Finally, there’s Luckyman, and Arale from Dr. Slump (aka Dragonball creator Akira Toriyama’s other manga). The website offers a little more insight on the source material for all the represented series so give it a look if you’re lost.

Other manga franchises set to be represented with playable characters include famous titles such as Bleach, Fist of the North Star, Yu Yu Hakusho, Saint Seiya, and Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure. Popular series such as Gintama, Assassination Classroom, Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo, Toriko, and Hunter x Hunter will also feature playable appearances on the roster. J-Stars will also boast a selection of support characters to assist players in battle, and these will include faces from Kuroko’s Basketball, To Love-Ru, Sket Dance, Nisekoi, Haikyu!!, and D. Gray-man.
