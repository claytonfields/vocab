The House passed legislation on Tuesday that would reauthorize programs to conduct medical research and transplants using stem cells from bone marrow and umbilical cord blood.

Passed by voice vote after only about ten minutes of debate, the bill authorizes $23 million annually for the National Cord Blood Inventory Program and $30 million per year for the C.W. Bill Young Cell Transportation Program through fiscal 2020.

The stem cells from bone marrow or umbilical cord blood collected after a birth can be used for transplants for blood-related diseases like leukemia.

The stem cell research reauthorized by the legislation does not include the use of destroyed human embryos, which is a more controversial form of using stem cells.

House Republicans are in the midst of figuring out a strategy to avoid a government shutdown on Oct. 1 while placating conservatives’ demands to defund Planned Parenthood in the wake of controversial undercover videos regarding the organization’s use of aborted fetal tissue for medical research.
