Aww, that’s so cute!

Except those property rights you’re deriding are often the only thing keeping lgbt seniors in their homes after the death of their partners.

That “capitalist crap” you mention includes shared pensions and access to partner 401(k) rights, which often means the barrier between destitution and relative comfort in old age.

It means access to your partner’s healthcare programmes. It’s the ability to adopt your partner’s children so that you can do something as mundane as pick them up from school, and as important as file a missing person’s report. It’s the ability to make medical decisions in extremis for your partner, and for them to be notified if you get hurt. It means if you die, your body isn’t turned over to homophobic relatives against your wishes.

It means immigration rights, school access, right-to-life powers.

It means being seen as equal citizens under the law.

If you don’t want to get married, by all means don’t, but don’t you dare subject the rest of us to your bullshit white suburban reject anarchism.
