The FBI says it has captured the last of two additional suspects in the kidnapping of 63-year-old Frank Janssen from his Wake Forest home.

Jakym Camek Tibbs, 21, aka "Jak", was captured in Harrisburg, Pa., just before 7 a.m. Monday, according to an FBI spokesperson.

Quantavious Thompson, 18, aka "Quan" was captured last week.

Authorities said Janssen was targeted by an imprisoned Bloods gang member - 49-year-old Kelvin Melton - who allegedly masterminded the kidnapping from his jail cell in Butner. Melton allegedly gave instructions on how to kill Janssen and dispose of his body.

Janssen is the father of the Wake County prosecutor who sent Melton to prison.

The group allegedly used a Taser to subdue Janssen on April 5 and then drove him to an apartment in Atlanta, where they started making demands by text message. A special FBI team located and rescued Janssen April 10.

In addition to Melton, the other five charged in the case are:

Jenna Paulin Martin, 21

Tiana Maynard - AKA "Tiana Brooks", 21

Jevante Price - AKA "Flame", 21

Michael Montreal Gooden - AKA "Hot", 22

Clifton James Roberts, 29

All face federal kidnapping charges. If convicted, they face the possibility of a maximum sentence of life without parole and a $250,000 fine.
