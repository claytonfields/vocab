UK certified diamond specialist Marlows Diamonds has claimed to have found a new thorny, palm-like plant in West Africa, which signals the presence of diamonds beneath it.

The Pandanus candelabrum plant has been identified as a method to identify columns of kimberlite pipes, which release eruptions that can raise faster bringing diamonds to the surface.

The Liberian plants are expected to make searching for diamond easier in areas that have suffered greatly from the Ebola epidemic.



"This species of plant could dramatically change the way that West African nations search for diamonds."

Pandanus candelabrum is said to enjoy kimberlite-rich soil that thrives on magnesium, potassium and phosphorous and has been spotted at various kimberlite sites.

Diamond hunters can use geo-botany to indicate potential diamond spots and benefit from a cost-effective search method.

Marlows Diamonds spokesperson said: "This species of plant could dramatically change the way that West African nations search for diamonds.

"For those looking to buy premium and ethically sourced diamond products, it is imperative to always search for a GIA or IGI certification."

Nations depending on diamond trade to support their economies can use geo-botanical mapping to source diamonds, a process that will also cut exploitive labour methods.
