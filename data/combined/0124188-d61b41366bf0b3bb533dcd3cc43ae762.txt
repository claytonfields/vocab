This is the (mirrored) face of Chevrolet’s next-generation 2016 Cruze for North America that will be presented on June 24. We say ‘mirrored’ because GM’s original picture only showed half of the compact sedan’s face, so we used digital means to mirror the other half.



Compared to the Chinese-specification 2016 Chevrolet Cruze that had its debut in April of 2014, the North American model’s fascia features some styling changes including the shape of the grille and headlamps, as well as the hood.

Chevrolet had previously shared some photos of the car’s interior to showcase the newly-developed infotainment system with a standard 7-inch or optional 8-inch screen that will work with both Apple Carplay and Android Auto.

GM said that the new Cruze will “build on the current model’s success” offering a larger yet lighter body, with new technologies, new engines and transmissions, and additional available safety features “that will bring a higher level of sophistication to the compact car segment”.

While Chevrolet will present the car later this month, it won’t go on sale in the States until early 2016. In addition to GM’s Lordstown, Ohio plant, the new Cruze will also be manufactured at the firm’s revamped Coahuila facility in Mexico and in China.
