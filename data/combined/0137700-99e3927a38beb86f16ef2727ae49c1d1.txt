Earlier today I said that Cuba Gooding Jr. only does direct-to-DVD movies now. Obviously that is not completely true seeing as he is in Red Tails and that came out in theaters this past weekend. After I said this though I went to his IMDB page and checked out the movies he’s done in the last few years and I’m still going to say that he is the new Steven Seagal. Let’s call him Cuben Seagal Jr., Steben Gooding Jr. or my personal favorite Blacken Goodal Jr.!

You can’t see it but the quote is from the movie critic at Ok! Magazine.

Christian Slater as a priest? WTF…

No one f$cks with Cuba’s vacation lake house!

Holy sh$t Christian Slater is on here twice!

Only one man can solve the immigration issue: Cuba F$cking Jr. wearing aviators!

Holy sh$t. Helen Mirren and my man Cuba as contract killers? This must be awesome! Helen’s character has cancer? Ok. She raised Cuba? Interesting. Their lovers? My eyes are bleeding!!!! Stop the pain…
