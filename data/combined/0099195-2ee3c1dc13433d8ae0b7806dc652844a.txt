Looks like the TARDIS fell out of the Time Vortex and landed in an strange new dimension.Honestly, I can't believe I haven't seen something like this before. Now I'm not saying one doesn't exist, just that I haven't seen it.Anyway, I think it turned out well. Took me forever to find a TARDIS picture from a good angle to get the desired result.I especially like Ditzy Doo's expression here.---FIRST EDIT, Nov. 27, 2011:Changed the color of the TARDIS light to better match the show. For some reason, I thought it blue. I also added a faint green glow to the Doctor and Ditzy, emanating from the TARDIS interior.--Doctor Whooves vector made by * Zork-787 Ditzy Doo/Derpy Hooves vector made by ~ solusjbj TARDIS photo belongs to the BBC [link]
