AFL games will be played on free-to-air television from this weekend.

New Zealanders will be able to watch the live AFL games for free beginning this weekend on TVNZ's Freeview pop-up channel.

TVNZ's director of content Jeff Latch says TVNZ is excited to be partnering with the AFL and bringing such an iconic Australian sport to Kiwi lounges in a free-to-air capacity after signing a multi-year deal.

"We're not sure if it will fuel a complete change from NZ's rugby psyche just yet but we know Kiwis will appreciate the skill and pace of the game," he said in a statement today.

TVNZ will also air the AFL's Weekly Highlights Program and has the rights to air key AFL events including the Season Launch, Australian Football Hall of Fame, Rising Star, All Australian, Grand Final Parade, Brownlow Medal and the AFL Draft.

AFL general manager â€“ game development, Simon Lethlean, said TVNZ's expanded AFL coverage was a great result for fans of the game.

"As AFL club, KiwiKick and AFL9's participation continues to grow in New Zealand so does the interest in watching AFL matches," he said.

Last month TVNZ secured free-to-air live coverage of PGA, LPGA and European Tour Golf tournaments to air on the Freeview pop-up channel platform through to the end of October.

AFL coverage will kick-off this weekend on Freeview channel 13 with a replay of West Coast vs Hawthorn at 2.30pm on Saturday and then live coverage of Fremantle against the Swans at 5pm and the Bulldogs taking on the Crows at 9pm.
