"I told my team, 'Don't ever take pictures with nothing that's not yours, nothing that you haven't earned,'" Ray Lewis said, via the Baltimore Sun. "When we hold that Lombardi, whoever holds that Lombardi next Sunday, you've earned it when you touch it. And don't fool yourself and try to trick yourself, 'This feels great.' "

They have 60 minutes of work left for a chance to pose with the real Lombardi Trophy.
