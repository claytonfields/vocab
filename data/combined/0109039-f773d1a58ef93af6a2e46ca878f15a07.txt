Boston Marathon bombing survivor Roseann Sdoia is set to marry the firefighter who rescued her.

According to the New York Post, Sdoia and Mike Materia got engaged during a trip to Nantucket in December, according to the Associated Press, and are planning a fall wedding.

Sdoia was watching the marathon in April 2013 when a bomb went off just feet away from her, the explosion caused her to lose a part of her right leg. Materia, a Boston firefighter, came to her aid, stayed with her on the ride to the hospital, and visited Sdoia during her recovery. They became friends and began dating two months after the bombing.

"He's seen me on my worst day," Sdoia told the New York Post.

The couple is scheduled to be in New York on Wednesday night to participate in the 40th annual Empire State Building Run-Up to raise money for charity.

They plan to marry this fall and are releasing a book next month titled "Perfect Strangers," about four people affected by the bombing.
