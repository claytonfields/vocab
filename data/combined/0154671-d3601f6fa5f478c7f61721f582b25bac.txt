Melo: ‘Mistake to join Juventus’

By Football Italia staff

Inter midfielder Felipe Melo admits joining Juventus “was a mistake”, but isn’t writing them off in the Derby d’Italia.

The Brazilian spent two seasons with the Bianconeri, joining from Fiorentina in 2009, but admits he regrets the move.

“I’ve returned to embrace an old love,” Melo told La Repubblica of his move to Inter.

“Seven years ago I could have become an Inter player. [Jose] Mourinho wanted me, and I wanted him. In the end I went to Fiorentina, then to Juventus and then Galatasaray, where I won a lot.

“God wanted me here, so in the end I closed the circle. Juve was a mistake, I’d have been better going to Inter, I’d have won the treble.

“On Sunday I expect an opponent who deserves respect, they’re not dead.”
