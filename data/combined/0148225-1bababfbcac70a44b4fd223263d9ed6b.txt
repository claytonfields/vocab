HUNTSVILLE, Alabama -- Proponents of reviving the NCAA Division I hockey program at the University of Alabama in Huntsville will take perhaps the final shot tonight at changing minds.

Members of the Save UAH Hockey grass-roots effort will meet with new UAH President Robert Altenkirch tonight to discuss the hockey program, the school confirmed Monday.

Huntsville attorney Doug Martinson Jr., a vocal advocate for hockey, said the expectation is that Altenkirch may spell out specifically what is needed to sustain the program financially. That's something UA System Chancellor Malcolm Portera never did when he ended the 30-year program in October while serving as interim president at UAH, Martinson said.

"I guess it will be what (financial) number he throws out (to sustain the program)," Martinson said of any optimism going into the meeting. "We think we can come up with a plan.

"If they get in a conference and have home games, they will have more attendance and get a better deal at the (Von Braun Center). You bring in the alumni money and possibly more along with that."

Portera reduced the hockey program to club status in his final week as interim president, citing a $1.5 million annual price tag as being too expensive for the school to support.

Altenkirch started at UAH on Oct. 31 and said reviewing the athletic department finances would be among his top priorities. Altenkirch has completed that budget analysis, UAH spokesman Ray Garner said.

Garner said UAH may have a statement tonight.
