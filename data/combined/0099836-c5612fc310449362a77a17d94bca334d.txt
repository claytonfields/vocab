Call Goes Out for Bellator Reality Series Tryouts

Along with Bellator Fighting Championshipsâ€™ move from MTV2 over to Spike TV in January, the promotion has also announced that it intends to air a new reality series on its new network.

There have been few details released about the new reality series, but Bellator on Monday put out the call for open tryouts.

The tryouts are open for the 155 and 170-pound weight classes. Any fighter that applies must have at least three professional victories on their record and must not have an equal or greater number of losses than wins. All applicants must also be over 21 years of age.

The Bellator open tryouts are slated for Nov. 10 from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the American Top Team gym in Coconut Creak, Fla.

Applications can be downloaded at http://2.images.spike.com/downloads/bellator/Bellator-Long-App.pdf and video submission sent to CastingBellator@gmail.com.

The man in charge of developing the Bellator reality series is award-winning producer Bertrand van Munster, who was behind the CBS hit The Amazing Race and several other series.

The reality series format has been a big hit in the past for Spike TV when it partnered with the UFC for The Ultimate Fighter.
