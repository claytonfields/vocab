There are people who think it fiscally irresponsible to spend road dollars on bicyclists and pedestrians when most people still use cars to get around.

Case in point: The libertarian-minded Cascade Policy Institute think tank based in Portland and the proposed $299 million project to replace the Sellwood Bridge in Multnomah County.

Analysts at Cascade

pointing out that most of the new bridge will be dedicated to two percent of bridge users, "even though cars carry nearly 98 percent of all passenger-trips during the peak hours. Only about 40 percent of the new bridge will be allocated to vehicular travel, with the other 60 percent dedicated to non-motorized transportation in the form of bikeways and mega-sidewalks."

The essay acknowledges a need for more space for walkers and cyclists, but adds this: "However, there is no reason to allocate 60 percent of bridge space to satisfy two percent of all travelers."
