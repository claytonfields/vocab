Ohio State hockey is back in the Frozen Four for the first time in 20 years.

The Buckeyes last reached the national semifinals of college hockey in 1998. They’re going back this year, thanks to a 5-1 win over Denver on Sunday.

The Buckeyes will now take on Minnesota-Duluth in the semifinals of the Frozen Four. That game will be played on April 5.

If OSU wins, they could face Michigan in the national title game. The Wolverines will play Notre Dame in the other semifinal.

The national championship game is set for April 7.

Since Notre Dame is in the Big Ten for hockey, that means three of the four teams in the Frozen Four are from the Big Ten. Not too shabby.

The game time for Ohio State’s Frozen Four contest should be out shortly.
