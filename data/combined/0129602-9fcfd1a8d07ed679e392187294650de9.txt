Real Madrid's 6-1 Copa del Rey win over Cultural Leonesa at the Bernabeu on Wednesday extended the club's unbeaten run to 32 games in all competitions -- passing a mark set by Zinedine Zidane's former mentor Carlo Ancelotti.

Mariano Diaz scored a hat trick -- the first coming after just 23 seconds, the fastest goal of Zidane's reign. James Rodriguez put the home side two up then Mariano struck again before half-time. Zidane's son, Enzo, scored the fourth before Mariano completed his treble and Cesar Morgado put through his own net.

Madrid's last defeat was 2-0 at Wolfsburg in the Champions League on April 6 last season and since then they have recorded 24 victories and eight draws in all competitions, while scoring 92 goals and conceding just 29.

Zinedine Zidane watches on during the win over Cultural Leonesa.

Under Ancelotti with Zidane as his assistant, Madrid put together 26 wins and five draws during the 2013-14 campaign, with the team scoring 87 goals and conceding 20, with the run bookended by defeats in Clasicos to Madrid's rivals Barcelona.

Madrid next head to Barca's Camp Nou on Saturday as they look to close in on the club record of unbeaten games at 34, set during the 1988-89 season when Dutchman Leo Beenhakker was coach. Zidane's side then have Borussia Dortmund at home in the Champions League, before Deportivo La Coruna go to the Bernabeu in La Liga which could see the record broken.

The Primera Division record for matches unbeaten is held by Barcelona (39 games), set during the reign of current Blaugrana boss Luis Enrique during the 2015-16 campaign.

Juventus hold the European record for their unbeaten run of 43 matches when current Chelsea manager Antonio Conte was in charge back in 2011-12.
