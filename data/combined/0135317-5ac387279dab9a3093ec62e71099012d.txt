Earlier this year, .hack makers CyberConnect2 held a special event, where CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama shed some light on a possible .hack development in the future. It looks like that future might be coming sooner than expected, as he has revealed that the company is already working on plans for a new .hack title.

During a recent event to commemorate the first year anniversary of CyberConnect2’s Guilty Dragon, an iPhone/Android game that is in some way connected to the .hack universe, Matsuyama stated that the service for Guilty Dragon is going smoothly, and that if players continue supporting the game, it will increase the chances of releasing a new .hack title for PlayStation 3 or PlayStation Vita, a Vita version of .hack//G.U., or an HD remake of .hack and more.

“CyberConnect2 have already begun the planning for the latest installment of the .hack series, and it’s only a matter of time until we can make it a reality,” said Matsuyama at a recent art event, adding that CC2 are currently preparing for that time to come, and he hopes to continue seeing fans support Guilty Dragon and the developer.

Siliconera previously spoke to Matsuyama, and he confirmed that Guilty Dragon will be coming to North America and Europe “later on,” so when that happens, you might also be able to help make a new .hack a reality.
