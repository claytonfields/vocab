Sanders's "America" ad ranked the highest for making viewers feel happy and hopeful, according to the New York Times.

The ad features a montage of Americans from different parts of the country set to the Simon and Garfunkel song "America."

The lyrics "They've all come to look for America," play as Sanders greets supporters at rallies.

Spotcheck found that 80 percent of viewers said it made them feel at least a little happy and hopeful â€” including more than half of the Republicans who watched it.

When asked how often they'd run the "America" ad, more than half of those surveyed said they would advise the campaign to run it a lot, including 51 percent of Republicans and almost 60 percent of independents.
