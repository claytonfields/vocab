MONSTERS is a gripping sci-fi short that tells the story of Jenn, a bright, inquisitive 9-year old girl cloistered in an underground bunker with her parents and older brother.

Like a princess in an ivory tower from a Grimm Brothers fairy tale, Jenn (Caitlin Carmichael) has spent her entire life in her family's bunker, forbidden to venture outside due to the decimated world being ravaged by horrifying, mysterious monsters.

However, Jenn's curiosity gets the better of her.

She defies her parents, and manages to escape.

What she discovers outside the bunker changes her life forever.

Written, produced, and directed by filmmaking team Steve Desmond and Michael Sherman, MONSTERS is dark, and deeply unsettling.

The most valuable player in this eerie, claustrophobic short is young Caitlin Carmichael, who portrays Jenn with precocious charm.

When you first meet her, you instantly become invested in her well-being as she embarks on an odyssey to discover the truth about her world - and the monsters that inhabit it.

I will say the plot twist at the end of the film is completely unexpected, but it doesn't feel trite or arbitrary.

In fact, the shocking reveal may leave you feeling more disturbed at the film's conclusion than you did at its beginning.
