Itty Bitty Songbird Instructions

If you are at Chicago Brickworld 2016 right now, you have one of these little guys on your display. As part of my duties as Brickworld Master 2015, I created 555 of these for the express purpose of pimping the MOCs on awards night. If yours falls apart, you now have instructions for putting him back together.

A huge thanks goes out to CoWLUG members for helping me build the whole mess: Meghan & Ryan Nelson, Jim Miller, Derek Medina, Lester Marcinkowski, Donnie & Lauren Greenfield and Jordan Breithaupt. Also Dustin, Madi & Chase who stayed into the morning to get all the arms & heads done. Thanks too, to my Atomic Goblin crew, Bodhi & Dave for the final full body assembly.

And finally, thanks to Mel, Evan & Adam for staying up all night in the event hall to help me make sure all the MOCs were properly pimped. You guys are awesome! Medic!!! And thanks to Nick and all the awesomeness that is GamerLUG for making a space for all of us.
