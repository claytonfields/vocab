KALAMAZOO, Mich. (NEWSCHANNEL 3) - Police in Kalamazoo identify a man hours after he was found unconscious and bleeding from his head.

Authorities thought his distinctive boots would help identify him, instead it was a tip.

Kalamazoo Police are not releasing his identity and won’t disclose the tip that uncovered his identity, but said he is in critical condition and fighting for his life on Sunday.

Police have said they know where he was before he was found wounded and unresponsive, but they are still trying to unravel the mystery behind a man found unconscious and badly hurt early Sunday morning.

KDPS Lt. Brad Misner said, "As of right now it's kind of a mystery."

A mystery Misner said officers have spent most of the day trying to solve after responding to calls of a man found bleeding from his head along E. Alcott St. in Kalamazoo.

Misner said, "He was at a party, something happened. I don't know if he was intoxicated and hurt himself or if somebody hurt him."

The circumstances of the man’s injuries remain unknown and police say it is still not clear why or how he ended up here after a party on Lake St.

Misner said, "He was last seen right around twelve o'clock midnight so somewhere between 12 midnight and quarter to 8 he was located with blood on his head.”

Police say the victim is described as Hispanic or Pacific islander-Asian standing 5 feet tall and wearing white Donaldo boots.

Police hoping these clues will help determine what happened to the man.

He was transported to Bronson Hospital and is listed in critical condition.

KDPS is asking anyone that recognizes the boots or knows the description of the man or what happened to him call (269) 337-8994 or Silent Observer at (269) 343-2100.
