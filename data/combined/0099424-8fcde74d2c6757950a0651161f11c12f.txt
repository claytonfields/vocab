Last season, the Los Angeles Chargers offensive line was ranked second to last. Veteran quarterback Phillip Rivers was pressured 238 times last season and out of the 1, 510 total rushing yards the team totaled last season, 960 of them came after contact.

While there are other areas the Bolts need to address, shoring up their offensive line should be a top priority for the team if they hope to have Rivers behind center for a couple more seasons.

Aside from center Matt Slauson, the offensive line was a train wreck in 2016. The team has signed former Seattle Seahawk Russel Okung to a four-year deal worth $53 million and are likely parting ways with left tackle King Dunlap and have already parted with former first-round pick D.J. Fluker.
