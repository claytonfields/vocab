First grow, starting to flower under 18/6?

And here is a shot of the "flower" (











Now, I really don't want to get my hopes up... But this seems to mean it's a female...? These seeds are from a buddy of a buddy of mine. At first I thought these hairs+flowers might mean "auto-flowering", but after some research it looks like auto-flowering plants usually do not get very tall and sex very quickly... So that's out!



Some other reading I was doing suggested this might be "pre-flowering"? Does this mean I should switch to 12/12?



Any help would be much loved. :]
