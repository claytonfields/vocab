Nacho Monreal looks set to pen a new deal with the Gunners ending speculation over a return to Spain according to reports in his homeland.

The left-back enjoyed a fantastic season last year and has continued to be courted by Athletic Bilbao on account of his heritage and their strict policy regarding only signing players who hail from the Basque region.

The report first appeared in Mundo Deportivo claiming that Nacho had verbally agreed a new contract that would see him earn £75k per week.

Speaking in pre-season, Monreal said “I’m very happy at Arsenal.

“Of course I enjoyed playing in a lot of the games last season and that is the target again – that is all I can say right now.

“When you play for Arsenal, you know they are one of the biggest clubs in England but, here in Singapore, you see they are also one of the biggest clubs in the world.

“The reception we get from the fans everywhere we go is amazing to see for the players and we are very happy to be here with them.”

Ousting Kieran Gibbs from the first-choice slot, Monreal looks set to keep his place in the side ahead of the Englishman.

Monreal has 16 caps for Spain after receiving his first call-up in 2009 when he was 23.
