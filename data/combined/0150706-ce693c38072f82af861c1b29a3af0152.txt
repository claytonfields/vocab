OH baby!

A pregnant mum expecting to deliver a three kilogram baby gave birth to a girl weighing more than six kilograms.

Mia Yasmin Garcia was born by caesarean section at the San Luis Valley Hospital in the US on Monday, weighing a huge 6.3kgs and measuring 59cm long.

KUSA-TV in Denver reports the baby’s mother, Alisha Hernandez, was expecting a seven-pound infant.

Mia’s father, Francisco Garcia, says the newborn’s size shocked everyone, including hospital staff.

“They’re all shocked that they’re seeing a baby like that. Even in the San Luis Valley, they were like whoa! They opened their eyes like they’ve never seen a baby like that,” he told KUSA-TV.

The proud dad added that the couple’s three older daughters were all born at normal weights and the combined weight of their twins at birth was lower than Mia.

Shortly after she was born, Mia was flown to a Denver-area hospital suffering from low glucose levels and trouble breathing. She is reportedly doing fine.
