It seems that one Wife Swap participant might should of stayed with her new family! Season 2 alum and former Miss Teen New Jersey Jamie Czerniawski has been arrested for stabbing her husband Charles with a knife during a fight in their Freehold, New Jersey home on May 26. Jamie Czerniawski, 30, tells The New York Post that she acted in self defense, saying “I was so scared I just closed my eyes [and struck him] … If I didn’t do it, I would’ve been dead.”

Jamie claims the couple had just returned home at 1AM when a phone call from a mutual male friend sparked her husband Charles, 34, into a jealous rage. She says Charles told her, “If I can’t have you, no one can,” just after grabbing her wrists. She broke free and picked up a knife. Next, she says, Charles pinned her to the floor with his knees and that’s when she stabbed/slashed him.

Charles Czerniawski has “spent two days in intensive care, lost four pints of blood and hasn’t regained use of his right arm,” according to The Post. He disputed his wife’s claim that the attack was in self-defense, and his lawyer says his client will give “a detailed account of the true events” in court.

I scoured every inch of the virtual superhighway for a video clip without any luck (just give it time – I’m sure excerpts of the episode will surface) But, I was able to track down Jamie’s MySpace page (www.myspace.com/tanyourbunz) as well as the MySpace page for Jamie and Charles’ business, Aloha Tanning. Here are a few photos of the couple from her page, last updated on May 22 of this year:
