Former champion Victor Ortiz is shaking his head at the recent news that Floyd Mayweather Jr. will defend his WBC/WBA welterweight titles against Andre Berto on September 12th at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. The fight will reportedly take place on CBS as a free broadcast and not on a pay-per-view platform.

Ortiz was out in New York City getting ready to attend the premiere of his new boxing flick "Southpaw" -- when he went off on both Floyd and Andre Berto ... saying the matchup was a disgrace to the sport.

"That's embarrassing bro. That's not even a fight. If anything, they both need to retire. At least Floyd needs to give me some kind of a chance to redeem myself. I have no respect for that. I have no respect for a fight like that. If this [interview] keeps going I'll say a lot of bad things," Ortiz said.

Ortiz traded knockdowns with Berto in 2011, winning the welterweight title in a Fight of The Year battle. The victory landed him a fight with Mayweather later that year. Mayweather won by way of a controversial knockout in four rounds. Ortiz and Berto were set to have a rematch in 2012, but Berto failed a random drug test and the fight was cancelled. Berto was later vindicated when the evidence showed that he likely ingested a tainted supplement.
