NES has signed a new contract with Remontowa Shipbuilding, Gdansk for the delivery of two hybrid electric systems for two new ferries. The contract has a value of 25-30 mill NOK. The owner of the new ferries is Transport for London (TfL) and the LMG Marin 60-DEH design includes a propulsion system, which is the newest within green energy.

The ferries shall be operating the link between Woolwich and North Woolwich across the River Thames. The Woolwich Ferry has been operating since 1889 and carries around 20 000 vehicles and 2.6 million passengers a year across the River Thames.

Norwegian Electric Systems package consists of ultralight converters forming a DC-grid system with totally four battery packages, two on each side of the DC-bus breaker for redundancy. In addition, for the main propulsion there are used water-cooled, high efficiency permanent magnet motors and four direct driven propellers.

"We have had a good and close contact with Remontowa and LMG Design during this sales process", says Fridtjof Erichsen, regional sales manager in NES.

NES will, as usual, deliver a complete integrated DC-Grid system consisting of:

Generators

4 complete battery packs

permanent magnet motors for main propulsion

DC switchboards

Low loss Quadro DriveÂ® DC/AC and AC/DC

EMS and IAS

Project Management

Calculations/Engineering

Commissioning and sea trial

"We are proud to have won this contract," says Fridtjof. "It proves once again that NES is in the forefront when it comes to technology".

NES has already installed one of Europe`s largest test facilities for electric propulsion systems including energy storage. The new Energy Management System will also be a great advantage for future projects.
