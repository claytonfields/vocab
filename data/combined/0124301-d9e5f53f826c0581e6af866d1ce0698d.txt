Hi, I'm Martin Allien and this is my digital playground & mothership of my projects

Cryptocoins icons

Cryptocoins is the most complete free vector iconpack of your favourite cryptocurrencies.

Download & Demo on GitHub

Available in webfont & SVG format for taking advantage of small file sizes and unlimited scalability, Cryptocoins are perfect for usage on the web – right where they belong. Use them all or just the ones you need.

Installation

There are many ways/formats how to use Cryptocoins. The fastest and recommended way is via SVG directly. Or use the webfont version if you want to include all icons at once:

via SVG recommended – when you need just a few icons in your project

– when you need just a few icons in your project Webfont version – ideal when you want to include all icons at once Pro tip: Learn how to generate icon webfonts – it’s even better when you only include those you really need

NPM package – npm i cryptocoins-icons

CDN – both SVG icons and the webfont are available on jsDelivr

Requesting new icons

If you’re missing your coin, please let me know so I can include it in next release. Since there are many requests lately and I can hardly keep up, I have to ask you to follow these guidelines:

open a new issue in the official repo fill in the template (coin name, ticker symbol, link to official logo etc.) (optional) you can include HEX code of the main color used in coin’s branding and bitcointalk thread link (not mandatory, but saves me time) (optional) you can notify me on @AllienWorks Twitter (also, helps spreading the word)
