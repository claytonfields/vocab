Real-time hand-tracking with a color glove Robert Y. Wang and Jovan PopoviÄ‡

We demonstrate real-time tracking of the 3-D pose and configuration of the hand for gestural user-input and desktop virtual reality. The only components of our system are a cloth glove and a webcam.

Gestural user input

Tracking the 3-D pose and configuration of the hand Our system is low latency (~100 ms) and can track the relatively fast motion of this sequence. Desktop virtual reality Our system can be used as an input device for desktop virtual reality. Bimanual rotation and scaling Here we demonstrate rotation and scaling of the Stanford bunny with both hands. Manipulating a virtual yoke Here we demonstrate controlling a (crude) flight simulator by manipulating a virtual yoke.

About the color glove The color glove is printed on a Lycra fabric and does not contain any obstructive sensors. The pattern is designed to be distinctive and facilitate robust tracking.
