Cajun Chicken Soup





This is one of those recipes born of having a bunch of odds and ends and not wanting to go to the store. But YUM!

Cajun Chicken Soup

2 T olive oil

1 onion, chopped

2 stalks celery, chopped

clove garlic, pressed

3-5 andouille chicken sausage links (any andouille will do), chopped

1 quart chicken stock or broth

2 whole tomatoes (do not chop yet) or canned diced tomatoes

1 cup leftover shredded chicken (or boil up a thigh or two and shred)

medium zucchini, chopped (*See note)

1/2 tsp oregano

1 T dried parsley

1/2 tsp paprika

cayenne, black pepper, salt, and extra water to taste

optional fresh cilantro for garnish

1. Saute garlic, celery, onion, and sausage in olive oil until onions are translucent.

2. Add stock and bring to a boil. If using fresh tomatoes, drop whole tomatoes in boiling broth until the skins split then run under cold water to remove skins. Chop and return to pot.

3. Add chicken, parsely, oregano, paprika, and zucchini. Simmer for 5-10 minutes until zucchini is tender.

4. Adjust seasonings and add water if you want it soupier. Garnish with optional cilantro and serve.

*Note: I didnâ€™t chop my zucchini in the picture. I used my new fave tool the julienne slicer to make my zukes noodly. This is not necessary.
