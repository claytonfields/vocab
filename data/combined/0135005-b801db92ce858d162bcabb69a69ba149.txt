Are you bored with your job, but enthralled by the mysteries of nature? Wish your days were filled with a few more dinosaur bones and giant squids? Well, step right up, because the Museum of Natural History has a golden opportunity for you!

The Museum is seeking applicants for their Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) program, a 15-month curriculum that trains people to become science teachers, with the Museum itself as its classroom. Students will learn all about totally awesome stuff like planets, water, weather, and geology, plus possibly the ancient curse that causes the animals to come alive at night.

Tuition is free and students get a $30,000 stipend and health benefits, though graduates must commit to spending four years teaching in a high-needs public school and will face assignment anywhere in New York state. The program is part of a push to get more science teachers into New York schools, who are facing a serious shortage of math and science experts. "We’re looking for people who want to make a career of teaching and stay in the business,” said Ellen Futter, president of the museum, “whether they be just out of college or former participants in a volunteer corps or career changers or veterans.” If this sounds like the coolest job on the planet, get cracking on this here application, which is due January 31.
