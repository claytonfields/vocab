A 12-year-old girl who was found walking naked and eating out of trash cans in a Temecula neighborhood appeared to be staying inside her mother's car for hours at a time, according to a resident.

Dominique Prado, who lives in the neighborhood, told the Press-Enterprise that she and her husband last week saw the girl naked and shoeless, holding a piece of bread. The couple got food for the girl and called 911.

Prado said police later told her that the girl's mother kept her naked in the car so she would stay there while the woman worked as an aide in a local school, the Press-Enterprise reported.

The mother, Tracy Betts, was arrested Friday after officers, acting on tips, found the girl sitting without clothes in a car parked near Vail Elementary school.
