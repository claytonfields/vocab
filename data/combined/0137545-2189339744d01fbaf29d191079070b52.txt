DAYTON, Ohio (WDTN) - It was the first day on the job for the University of Dayton's new president Eric Spina.

He spent his first day on the job addressing faculty and staff for the very first time. He talked a lot about the importance of bridging partnerships with students and community establishments--like local businesses and area hospitals.

Community engagement was one of the main focal points of the work he did at Syracuse University. There, he spent 28 years working in several positions--including serving 9 years as the school's vice chancellor and provost.

He says growing on U-D's engagement within in the community is main goal going into the new position.

"What we really want to do is form mutually beneficial partnerships," Spina said. "We'll bring some talents. We'll bring some unknowns and the community will bring other talents. It's that working together for mutual benefit that's important and one of the reasons why I'm here."
