Georgia Congressman and orthopaedic surgeon Dr. Tom Price was confirmed as Secretary of Health and Human Services early Friday morning after a long second hearing and a great deal of fretful debate. Price is seen as pivotal in administration efforts to scrap, overhaul, or otherwise undo Obamacare.

As Vox.com put it earlier today: “He’s the HHS secretary you’d pick if you were dead serious about dismantling the law.”

As with seemingly every nomination of late, Sen. Elizabeth Warren made the most overwrought and maudlin objections to Rep. Price’s nomination, saying that his experience in healthcare should “horrify” you and that he wants to “destroy fundamental protections that millions of Americans depend on.” (Also she said he has “no shame,” so obviously she hasn’t shut up yet.)

Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) in his remarks in opposition during the hearing tonight said:

And by the way, we all ought to understand that if confirmed, Congressman Price would be the captain, the captain of the Trump healthcare team. So what he says matters and what he offers, legistlatively, his positions and his votes. He voted again and again to repeal the Affordable Care Act. So it really matters.

Those are quite the endorsements. Price has stated his support for protections for preexisting conditions, saying no one should be denied coverage on that basis. But so avid is opposition to Price, and loyalty to Obama’s ACA, that he has even been attacked for wanting more cancer screenings.

But the tl;dr is this: He’s the new HHS Secretary, he supports repeal and replace, and Democrats despise him.
