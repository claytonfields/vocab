A guest at President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago mansion claims he gave Secret Service agents the slip to snap a selfie in Trump’s private study — but the president’s security detail insists there was no breach.

“Snuck by secret service to catch this selfie. They might have told us not to go in there,” Joseph Young posted on Instagram on Saturday night, along with a photo of himself alone in the poshly appointed room with a painting of a youthful Trump behind him.

But officials say Young didn’t sneak past anyone.

“Those reports are all false,” Secret Service spokeswoman Catherine Milhoan told The Post on Sunday. “No one got past the Secret Service.”

A Secret Service source added to the Web site TMZ that guests were allowed in the study.

Another guest even posted a photo of himself and his mom in front of the Trump portrait, too.
