NBC’s Chiller could be the next horror channel to end up six feet under.

Cox announced that it will be dropping the horror channel on November 8, 2017.

The Cox decision means that Chiller has lost access to more than 40 million homes in less than eight months, explains TV Answer Man. (Cox has roughly 4 million video subs; Dish has slightly less than 14 million; Charter has slightly less than 17 million; and Verizon has slightly less than 5 million.)

Verizon quietly dropped Chiller from all systems on October 1, while Charter and Dish removed it in February and April of this year respectively.

Here’s the irony: Comcast, the nation’s largest cable operator, still does not carry Chiller, although it owns the channel via NBC. (DIRECTV and U-verse are Chiller’s two biggest carriers.)

While Bloody Disgusting received no response to inquiries, an NBC spokesperson issued this statement to the aforementioned site: “NBCUniversal values Chiller as the leading cable net dedicated to the horror genre.”

It’s worth noting that the second season of Chiller’s original series, “Slasher”, is heading directly to Netflix tomorrow. The show’s publicist also didn’t return my emails.

We’ll keep you posted on further updates but it’s looking as if Chiller is going to need a burial plot next to Fearnet.
