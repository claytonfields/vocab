Tampa Bay Lightning prospect Taylor Raddysh of the Erie Otters has joined teammate Alex DeBrincat in the century club.

One of three Lightning prospects on the Otters roster, Raddysh scored his 38th goal of the season and pitched in with two assists to bring him to 100 points on the season as Erie lost a wild one in Niagara by a score of 9-7 on Sunday.

The Caledon Ont. native has been a front-line contributor with the Otters this season, spending much of his time on a line alongside DeBrincat and Arizona Coyotes first round pick Dylan Strome. He becomes the sixth player in Otters history to reach 100 points in a season.

Raddysh was the OHL’s Player of the Month for October and joined DeBrincat in sharing the honours for November. He played a key role in Team OHL’s success in the 2016 CIBC Canada/Russia Series, scoring twice and adding an assist in a 5-2 win over Team Russia in Hamilton.

After making a strong impression with Team OHL, Raddysh earned a spot on Canada’s National Junior Team, tying a Canadian World Junior record with four goals in one game. He finished the tournament with five goals, one assist and six points over seven contests as Canada came away with silver.

A second round (58th overall) pick by the Lightning last summer, Raddysh’s 100 points (38-62–100) place him second in OHL scoring. He leads the league in both assists (62) and plus/minus (plus-64).

Raddysh, who also recorded his 200th career OHL point on Sunday, was Erie’s first round (19th overall) pick in the 2014 OHL Priority Selection from the Toronto Marlboros Minor Midgets.
