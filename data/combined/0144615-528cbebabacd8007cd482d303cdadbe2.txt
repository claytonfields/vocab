Stephen Colbert is generally keeping a low profile in the news media while he prepares to take over CBS’ “The Late Show” from David Letterman in September. But he gave a video interview to the Catholic publication America Magazine that offered a glimpse into his personal faith credo.

During the long run of “The Colbert Report,” Colbert often billed himself as “America’s foremost Catholic.” He proves his bona fides in this nearly seven-minute interview with Father Jim Martin, the magazine’s editor at large. He riffs on his favorite hymns, passages from scripture and explains why the “super flawed” Peter is his favorite saint. And for good measure, he throws in a quote from Frank Herbert’s “Dune.”

Colbert is also set to don a collar to play a clergyman in an upcoming episode of “The Mindy Project,” as creator/star Mindy Kaling teased in a tweet last month.
