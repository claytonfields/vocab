On his trip to Greece, President Barack Obama mentioned Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks, saying, “Greek or American, we’re all cheering for Giannis Antetokounmpo.”

When Antetokounmpo was asked today about his thoughts on being mentioned by the President in his home country, Giannis stood up and joked with teammate Tony Snell.

“See? I told you!” Giannis said.

(I laughed and lost track of where I was pointing the camera.)

“It’s a nice feeling that President Obama is talking about you while he’s in Greece,” the 21-year-old forward said. “Wow. It’s exciting. I got a lot of messages from my mother and people in Greece who were talking about it. It’s nice, and I appreciate it.”

On the same topic, Bucks head coach Jason Kidd said that Antetokounmpo had received a notable recognition.

“I think that’s awesome,” Kidd said. “It shows (Obama’s) awareness of the game of basketball and also the talent that Giannis has. That’s a great honor.”
