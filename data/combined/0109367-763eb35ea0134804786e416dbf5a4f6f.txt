If you read my translation of the “Letter from Leningrad” written by Boris Tishenko in 1975 here, you will definitely be interested in this 1975 recording of Shostakovich’s Viola Sonata Op.147 dedicated to and performed by Fyodor Druzhinin (Read more about Fyodor Druzhinin [Фёдор Серафимович Дружинин] here), piano accompaniment by Mikhail Muntyan. Excerpt from B. Tishenko’s letter:

Shostakovich’s love was an important engine of his artistic might; artistic might was also the reason for his being loved. Proof of his love and his remarkable ability to listen and admire music of others is evident in his Viola Sonata. In it exists, thinned to the limits, music-associative series; Shostakovich in his late works used musical quotations. A smart and tactful quotation exists in the finale of the Viola Sonata: the characteristic point from Beethoven’s 1st movement of the “Mondschein” Sonata Op.27., No.2, only transcribed from triple into quadruple metre.
