CARRICK (KDKA) – While much of the nation watches what is happening in Ferguson, Missouri, a local mother wants people to pay attention to what is happening closer to home.

Heather Mellon lost her son to gun violence and how she wants to put an end to it.

“We are trying to raise awareness of gun violence,” Mellon said.

The mother of 18-year-old Mikey Polombia held an event on the anniversary of her son’s death.

“My son is a victim of crime, of gun violence and now — at the age of 18-years-old — I will never see him grow up, have a family, be successful. Put the guns down. That’s all I am saying. We don’t need gun violence,” Mellon said.

Polombia was shot on Nov. 25, 2013. His body was found near the Brownsville Inn in Carrick.

Someone found him lying on the sidewalk. Polombia was taken to UPMC Mercy Hospital, but died of his injuries a short time later.

“My life is totally shattered. I completely miss my son and if I could bring him back, I would bring him back in a heartbeat. What this guy did to my son and our family shook our whole lives up,” Mellon said.

They auctioned off baskets, had a Chinese auction and had a balloon release.

“He was 18-years-old, just graduated high school. He was just becoming a man, which got robbed one year ago,” Mellon said.

The money they raised benefits the Center for Victims, which is an organization that helped the Polombia family following his death.

While a year has passed, Mellon is still adamant about her mission.

“I will never stop, never, as long as I live putting the word out in my name and trying to get the guns off the streets,” she said.
