Officers drag woman from LAX-bound flight after alleged dispute about dogs on plane. A woman was forcibly removed from a Southwest flight on Tuesday after she claimed to have a life-threatening pet allergy but refused to leave the plane. While boarding, the woman notified Southwest staff of her allergy after seeing two dogs, one a pet and the other a service animal, on the flight with her. However, she was unable to provide proof that she could fly safely with the animals. Southwest said their policy states that "a customer (without a medical certificate) may be denied boarding if they report a life-threatening allergic reaction and cannot travel safely with an animal onboard." Airline staff asked her to exit the plane multiple times, but she refused. Police officers were called to the plane and removed her despite her objection
