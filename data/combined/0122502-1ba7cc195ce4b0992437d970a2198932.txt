Stuff like this never happens in Silicon Valley, so it's big news here.SAN JOSE -- Two San Jose police officers shot and killed a man in the Blossom Valley neighborhood on Saturday afternoon, ending a wild 20-minute chase on Highway 85 and through residential streets.The suspect, who is about 25 years old but was not identified as of late Saturday night, died after he fled his disabled car on the 5800 block of Blossom Avenue, near Mohican Drive, in South San Jose.Two officers "felt the suspect presented an imminent danger," said Sgt. Jason Dwyer, a spokesman for the San Jose Police Department. Believing the suspect was armed, "both officers fired, he went down and was pronounced dead at the scene."It was the first officer-involved shooting of the year in San Jose. There were four last year and eight in 2011, Dwyer said.The episode started at 2:30 p.m. in the area of Camden and Union avenues, where a police officer spotted a driver who was acting suspiciously, Dwyer said.Details about his behavior were not available, but the neighborhood has recently suffered a spate of daytime residential burglaries.The officer did not initially chase him, believing it unsafe in a residential neighborhood. But the officer eventually spotted and followed the suspect's tan Ford Contour.
