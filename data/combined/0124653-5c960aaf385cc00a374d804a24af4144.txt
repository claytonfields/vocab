My Colors Santa sent me this unbelievably adorable hand-made, felt dinosaur coin purse! It's purple - my favorite color. And a dinosaur, my favorite everything (besides my family, obviously haha)!!

Thank you Santa, this purse is so adorable and will fit perfectly in our diaper bag! Coins are an issue, especially considering I have two little monsters who could potentially choke if I have coins just sitting around. Not to mention, my 2 year old LOVES those rides in the mall, so it's nice to have change around (and now I have somewhere to put it!)

This little dinosaur has been busy getting used to his new forever home! We fed him some lettuce and raisins (he's not yet house trained, as we found out....). He would have preferred the plants outside, but we just got a bunch of snow! After roaming with the other dinosaurs a while, he settled down by reading a book. This dinosaur sure is an adventurous little guy! I think I am going to call him Mac. :D

Thanks again!!
