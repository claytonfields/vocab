We have some bad news for ATI fans, AMD has announced that it will be killing the ATI brand in favor of its Fusion project which aims to build hybrid CPU and GPU chips. The Radeon and FirePro branding will be remaining intact, but ATI Eyefinity will now be known as AMD Eyefinity and the first set of graphic cards to be shipped with the new branding strategy will be released later this year.

The company also claimed that this is the perfect time AMD could possibly consolidate the ATI brand, because Radeon products are performing well in terms of sales, and there’s high market penetration of AMD’s graphics products. Finally, AMD revealed the new brand logos that are nearly identical to the present ATI logos, of course, minus the “ATI”.
