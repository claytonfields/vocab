Will Roush, the notorious New York Rangers fan-turned-viral fascination who spent "hundreds only" on tickets to Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals this past May is back. No, not in Madison Square Garden. This time, the Connecticut native is on a New York City rooftop blowing money fast (and out of a money gun) with former Brooklyn Nets center Mason Plumlee.

Following a draft day trade, "Plumdog Millionaire" is now a member of the Portland Trail Blazers, but a change of scenery won't keep him from "killin' the game." But did Plumlee hold his own on the track? You be the judge: Listen to Plumlee's verse for yourself, and read through our transcription of it below.

I’m with the waterboy, Bobby Boucher

Evian bottles on replay

No Cuvée, no D’ussé

That agua needs two trays

At the Rangers game

I side with no lames

Already on the bench, give my boy Roush that 10-day

[Benjamin Franklin is killlin’ the game!]

It’s your boy Plums that’s my name

Money gun

What up, I’m Plumdog Millionaire with no aim

[Benjamin Franklin is killin the game!]

I seen Jay at the game

Hey, What up Hovi

Look at my jersey I’m the one and only

Tell the Russians I said: "Hundreds only"

Like Moss said, "Straight cash, homie."

Ben Franklin, we will clone

It was love at first sight with that college loan

I smash on my last song

Look I don’t rap, but when in Rome

Is a collaboration with Dame DOLLA on the way? We can only hope.
