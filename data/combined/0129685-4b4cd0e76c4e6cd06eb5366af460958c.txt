MINNEAPOLIS- Chaos erupted outside of the Minneapolis Federal Courthouse before testimony was set to resume in the terrorism trial of three men accused of plotting to join ISIL.

The sister of Abdirizak Warsame, who is currently on the stand testifying about how he and his friends planned to join ISIL, got into an altercation. Itâ€™s unclear exactly what led to the incident. She was seen shouting at FBI agents. She was quickly brought to the ground, handcuffed and escorted away.

Judge Michael Davis also called Burhan Mohumed, a friend of the defendants, to the front of court. Davis asked Mohumed if he was a part of the altercation. Mohumed told him he was trying to stop it. Judge Davis ordered that Mohumed be photographed and fingerprinted, then banned him from the courthouse for the duration of the trial.

The incident delayed court by an hour.

Once testimony got underway Warsame told jurors that he and his friends believed if they went to Syria and joined ISiL they would be among the higher ranks of fighters. He also admitted after watching graphic ISIL videos that it was clear "if we were to go there, if we were ordered to kill them (hostages) we'd have to."

Under cross-examination, Warsame described watching an ISIL video where a hostage pilot was set ablaze. "To watch that video and see that pilot burn made me rethink a lot of things."

Testimony is set to resume Wednesday afternoon.
