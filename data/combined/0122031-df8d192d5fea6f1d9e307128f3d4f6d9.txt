I started off with a base of OPI My Vampire is Buff. This is a beautiful cream/off white. I love the way this polish looks and its a good alternative from stark white.









Using acrylic paints and a tiny paint brush I freehanded this plaid look. About halfway through I decided trying to freehand a geometric look was not the best decision I've ever made. However, I rather like what I ended up with, so I'm calling it a success.

The Lacquer Ring is back for its final prompt in July. Jessica of Once Upon a Polish picked geometric for our art theme this month. I really wanted to free hand a design this time around since my freehanding failed in June.
