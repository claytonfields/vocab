I needed a new razor as the battery on the old razor finally gave up the ghost. After much research and reading many reviews, I chose this razor. I've had the razor for a bit over a month and have charged it twice.



It looks good on the bathroom counter while taking up little space standing in it's counter top holder, has a strong motor, no fancy whistles or bells and doesn't bog down when giving you a shave. I find that I have to pass it over my hard to shave facial areas several times more than I would expect but very comfortable and no razor burn. For me, a clean, satisfying shave which is what it's all about day-after-day, six/seven days a week. The razor holds a charge for over a week and makes for an excellent travel razor you can depend on.



Expensive? Maybe. But when you go into a drugstore to find an electric razor, junk stuff costs three-quarters of what this costs. So, for the price, considering the alternatives on today's drugstore shelves, money well spent. After over a month of using this tiger, I won't hesitate to give this razor a big thumbs up recommendation

Note: For continued close shaves, I recommend brush cleaning the blade set every week or two. Hair and debris builds up under the blades, raising the blades away from the skin in the process, preventing the closest possible shave. Yes, agreed, it's a pain to clean the blades but doing so, for me, immediately restores the close shave feeling I look for in an electric shave.



Update information. Recently (Mar 12) I used the razor on an eight day vacation and didn't need to charge the razor. I'm still using the original blade set and getting what I consider to be a close shave. And yes, FWIW, close at hand, I have a new set of blades and currently find no need to replace the original set of blades. :)



Hope the above helps.
