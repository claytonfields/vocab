Hi community, Sinetek here.Some of you may recognize me, as I've been in the community for a while now. I have been working for a while now on the Mobile Wallets front, and today I'd like to push a public test.This is a full-node Android Wallet for BlackCoin.So far the wallet seems to work best on tablets running Android version 4. My goal today would be to get feedback and screenshots etc.ISSUES ---the theme doesn't always load up correctly. the app should look like this: http://i.imgur.com/WKqgC9p.png some crashes while playing with the 'pay to' field..sending coins isn't well tested.. use caution for nowneed a 'copy address' button.Staking will come with the second update, once we're on the Play Store, probably.Download link:Thanks to all!!! Cheers

Okay so after my last post about my paper wallet idea i've got some pretty positive responses and decided to work my concept out a little more. I've changed the name from "Blackcoin Safepaper" to "Blackcheque" so that you can use it also for promotional purposes like giveaways / gifts etc.Here is the new design and also the inner paper. Obviously i've tried to make it look a little more luxurious with some signatures etc. but im still working on perfectionizing that.Im still working on a better design as always. But I thought i keep you all updated so that i can receive some feedback and help during the way.

Today I went to the Dutch Blackshape dealer to check out their fantastic airplane that you can buy with Blackcoin. Since I have gotten my pilot license as an 16 year old I've made a testflight and it's just simply an amazing airplane! I've flown mostly Cessna's and AT-3 but this aircraft is just a masterpiece. I guess I can call it the Lamborghini under the airplanes in general aviation.And guess what..Thanks to the Blackcoin community and the profits I could make on Mintpal I have finally managed to get all my funds together! The order has been made!Because I am so thankfull for you guys, as the Blackcoin community, I want to get it painted Blackcoin colorscheme/style, with the Blackcoin logo! This would be very cool since I will fly alot with it and also do demo flights for new, interested investors. This way they can hear about Blackcoin. Besides that, im also going to rent out this plane. So other pilots can rent my plane, which they can pay with Blackcoin aswell!However, getting it custom painted costs around 10.000$ I was hoping if people from this AWESOME Blackcoin community would consider donating for this project. The airplane costs me a fortune alreadyIf you want to see a real Blackcoin airplane that im going to use for BC promotions and rent it out which you can pay for with Blackcoin then help me out!! Im sure we can do thisI will keep you all updated and also I will show some BC colorscheme/style sketches in the near future.BC: BDYeU3GJoX3B4wB1x1XGerFbqzqcYeG1LjBTC: 12ARzb8Y1uLVPUZaji9TejAt7hScUwWEj4

can't wait to see how much people will be crying why did i not buy bc in less then a week bad times are behind the best is omost near, i can't even comprehend what will be next i suspect the team is hiding something that will make bc go viral world wide

If I flew over to NL some time this week would you be willing to do an interview for BlackCoinTV on camera with your new plane? It would be a great opportunity to find out more about your project.
