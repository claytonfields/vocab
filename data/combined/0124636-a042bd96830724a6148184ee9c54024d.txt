Mr. Hertzog is responsible for founding MetaCafe, Israel’s definitive video sharing website, as well as a founder of Bancor.

Proxy is pleased to announce the start of an incredible partnership — not only between Mr. Hertzog and Proxy Card, but an ongoing relationship between Bancor and Proxy.

Eyal is the founder of MetaCafe, Israel’s largest video sharing site, and more recently a founder of Bancor (who just raised over $150 million USD in their ICO).

Over the coming months, Eyal and Bancor will be supporting us with product development guidance along with advice on how to successfully conduct our token sale. We are working hard to make sure that we can support Bancor protocol in our proprietary app, and that means a better product for you.

We’re very excited to begin this partnership, and are incredibly lucky to have such a powerhouse team!
