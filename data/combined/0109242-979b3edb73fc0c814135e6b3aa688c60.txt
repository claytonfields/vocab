Yesterday, Cloud9 delivered the first upset of ECS Season 3 finals. Down 10-5 to defending champions and tournament favorites Astralis after the first half, the North Americans weren’t expected to make it to the playoffs, at least not on Friday.



A 19-15 turn-around victory in overtime shocked the audience at Wembley and Jake “Stewie2K” Yip was a large part why Cloud9 snatched the victory.



“For DreamHack I felt we were a bit mentally weak. Everything was going wrong for us, so it’s hard to play a tournament like this,” Stewie2k says regarding Cloud9’s recent disappointing performance at DH Summer 2017. The team finished bottom eight, exiting last in Group B behind CLG, Fnatic and Gambit and watched from the sidelines as SK Gaming took the trophy.

“Our showing against Fnatic was actually pretty good, but we threw the game kind of. But coming the London, we’ve had a few days practice. We’ve been lacking that fire in us. Shroud was the first guy to step up and say ‘We need to win this LAN, this is our LAN.’ Hearing this from a guy who usually doesn’t speak up gets us going.”



It needed more than a vocal player and rekindling the fire for Cloud9 to upset the ECS champions however. A shift in team’s inner structure was also set in place, Stewie2k says.



“Tim [autimatic] was IGLing a few months ago but he didn’t really like it. He thought it affected his gameplay, so he wanted me to go back to leading. It does affect my gameplay, but it seems our success rate with me calling is much better.”



Whatever the outcome of Group A is, Cloud9 will have a difficult opponent in the semi-finals, as the battle wages between FaZe Clan, G2 Esports and OpTic Gaming.
