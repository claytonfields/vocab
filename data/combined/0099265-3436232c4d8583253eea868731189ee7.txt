The other day, FedEx showed up at my door with a little surprise. I spotted my username on the shipping label and knew right away how it got here. I was so excited and opened it up as quickly as possible. The first thing I saw was a little note saying:

"Merry Christmas! I hope you enjoy your gifts! We tried to get all the items based on what you said. The LEDs for running, the sign for your guinea pigs, the minecraft keychain, and of course a lava lamp! Enjoy!!!"

I jumped with so much joy because my gift last year was not even CLOSE and personal to this one. It took a few business days for all FOUR gifts to arrive.

The first two gifts I received were the lava lamp and the LED light. They both constantly switched to different colors in time. The lamp is super neat and entertaining! The LED light will DEFINITELY come in handy when running in the night when no one can see you. Thank you for taking this into consideration!

The last two gifts were the "BEWARE OF GUINEA PIG" sign and Minecraft pickaxe keychain. The sign is so perfect for my guinea pigs' cage! I've already had a few people giggle from reading it. The last gift was a Minecraft keychain. Man, you have no idea how long I've been wanting one of these! It's a perfect addition to my dorky keychain collection!

I was looking all over for a username so I could thank them. All I have is the Secret Santa's full name. James, whoever you are, I can guarantee you that you made my Christmas a whole lot more hopeful this year. THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING!

Merry Christmas, Reddit!
