The first-ever X Games Real Mountain video contest has come to an end. Here's how the contest worked: Seven of North America's best big mountain ski resorts faced off in a battle to determine who has the best inbounds terrain. All of the footage in these videos was shot over the 2016/17 winter season and exclusively featured resort-sponsored athletes who ski and ride each resort on a regular basis. Only natural terrain features were allowed (no snowcat-made kickers), and all footage is of places you can get to from the top of a lift.

This was a fan-vote only contest, winner take all. When the dust settled, Wyoming's Jackson Hole Mountain Resort emerged as the winner. Thanks to all who voted in this year's contest. We'll see you again next year!
