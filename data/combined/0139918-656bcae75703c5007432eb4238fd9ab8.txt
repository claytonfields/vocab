Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he would welcome Trump canceling the visit

Washington (CNN) The White House has denied a report that US President Donald Trump plans to delay his state visit to the United Kingdom over fears of potential protests and his perceived unpopularity.

According to a report by the Guardian on Sunday , Trump revealed his unease during a conversation with British Prime Minister Theresa May in recent weeks, according to a Downing Street adviser who was in the room.

"The President has tremendous respect for Prime Minister May. That subject never came up on the call," the official told CNN.
