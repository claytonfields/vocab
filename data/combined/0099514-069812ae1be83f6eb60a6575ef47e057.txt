This Minecraft PE triple village seed was submitted by an Epic Minecraft player a few days ago. The seed has been floating around for awhile (it works in both 0.9x and 0.10x infinite), so we’re not sure if the submitter, Budderlord, was the first to find it, or if he was turned onto it by someone else. Regardless, the important details: there’s a massive triple village straight in front of you when you start the game.

The triple village is in a savanna biome directly across the river in front of you when the game renders. There are two blacksmiths in the village and one of them has emeralds amongst other loot (apples, ink sacs and iron ingots). We checked under all the wells and unfortunately didn’t find anything worth mentioning. When you spawn, your best bet is to get to the village fast before the careless blacksmith’s lava catches the chests on fire. The surrounding landscape beyond the savanna is river, desert and mountains (extreme hills). Thanks again to Budderlord for submitting the seed.
