On this episode of the Pony Bits Podcast, in case you couldn’t tell from the episode title, Jon and Colton tackle the subject of what exactly makes “Best Pony”. Jon sets up his own diagram to go over important factors to consider such as design, type of pony and personality. While they go over their own individual specifics of what they look for in their ideal “Best Pony”, Jon and Colton also talk about how realistic each of the Mane 6’s characters are, while juxtaposing that with how illogical the world they live in really is.

The podcast will be on hiatus until after October 19th when the duo will be back from Texas and can produce another episode, until then, enjoy the episode and send us some emails about your “Best Pony” requirements, the television show or the comics to read on the podcast at ponybitspodcast@gmail.com.
