One season after winning the 2014 Stanley Cup, the Los Angeles Kings missed the playoffs.

Off-Season Game Plan looks at a team that still has a championship core, but is looking at hard financial decisions this summer as they endeavour to get back to the playoffs next season.

The Kings were good enough to be a playoff team in 2014-2015, but despite having league-best possession stats, they were just 3-15 in overtime and shootout games. That there was some letdown following their Stanley Cup win wasn't any great surprise, but they were practically chasing the season once defenceman Slava Voynov was suspended early in the year and never quite got the results they needed.

Now, with Justin Williams and Jarret Stoll headed for unrestricted free agency, while Tyler Toffoli and Martin Jones are restricted free agents with appeal to other teams, the Kings are going to have to make tough calls to stay under the cap and maintain a team that still has legitimate Stanley Cup aspirations.

Trades, buyouts and free agent decisions figure to make for an interesting summer in Southern California.

It was a bit of a strange season for Anze Kopitar in 2014-2015. His point production was down a little, to the second-lowest rate (0.81 ppg) of his career, and he played 19:23 per game - the lowest average time on ice for his career and 90 seconds fewer than the year before.

As always, Kopitar was a dominant possession player, who could handle tough minutes, yet generated a career-low 1.70 shots per game. He's still a premier player at the age of 27, but there are a couple of red flags raised by last season's production.

Jeff Carter's 28 goals and 62 points were his highest totals since 2010-2011, and he has been a valuable addition since arriving in Los Angeles. He's usually anchoring the second line, with young wingers on his flank, but for a Kings team that runs into offensive problems from time to time, a nine-time 20-goal scorer like Carter is a crucial component.

Staying reasonably healthy, Marian Gaborik scored 27 goals but his offensive production is steadily declining at this stage of his career. His last point-per-game season was 2009-2010 and since then he's managed 180 points in 239 games (0.75 ppg), sliding to 0.67 points per game last season. A 33-year-old with declining production shouldn't come as a shock, but Gaborik is signed through 2021, so the Kings need that production to at least level off for the next few seasons.

In the early years of his career, captain Dustin Brown was a veritable bargain, providing inexpensive production, but now that he's signed a lucrative extension, his production - 26 goals and 54 points in 161 games over the past two seasons - isn't near what it needs to be in order to provide value. If the Kings are looking to maximize their salary cap flexibility, trading Brown would be a great place to start, though it will likely be challenging to find teams willing to invest long-term money in Brown's third-line productivity.

Dwight King's size and physical presence make him a useful bottom-six forward, but the Kings have occasionally pressed him into a top-six role and he's not suited to that situation long-term.

A veteran who tends to play a solid defensive game, Trevor Lewis did hit for a career-high 25 points last season, but he is still one of the least-productive forwards over the past five seasons. Craig Adams and Scott Gomez are the only other forwards to play more than 4,000 minutes in that time and score fewer than Lewis' 26 goals.

Tanner Pearson burst out of the gate last season, with seven goals in the first eight games, then scored five in the next 34 games before suffering a broken leg that prematurely ended his season. At this point, the 22-year-old is a complementary winger with upside, some of which was on display during the Kings' run to the 2014 Stanley Cup.

There may not be a more difficult situation for the Kings than how they will deal with Mike Richards. GM Dean Lombardi elected not to use a compliance buyout on Richards last summer and Richards responded with the worst year of his career, getting demoted to the AHL at one point. It's not as though he can't possibly play in the NHL, it's whether a team can afford a $5.75-million cap hit for a third or even fourth-line centre.

When it's not your money, it's easy to say the Kings should buy out Richards and move on, and maybe that is where this has to be headed but, with $22-million left on his contract, no general manager's ideal scenario involves paying nearly $15-million for someone not to play hockey for your team (if they would like, I will not play for them for far less!), especially when that means dead money sitting on your cap for the next decade.

For a team facing tight financial decisions this summer, it's almost inconceivable that they would commit long-term money to a fourth-line winger, but that's what the Kings did with Kyle Clifford, signing him to a five-year, $8-million deal. Clifford's a big bruiser who fits well on the Kings' fourth line, and he scored a career-high 15 points last season, but the Kings might not notice much difference playing some random free agent at half that price.

Another big, physical winger that toils on the Kings' fourth line, Jordan Nolan was also rewarded with a three-year contract extension. His price is more reasonable, but a winger with 29 points in 194 career games ought to come at a reasonable price.

A gritty winger trying to crack the NHL lineup, Andy Andreoff might have a better shot elsewhere, considering the commitments that the Kings have made on the low end of their depth chart.

Coming off a season in which he tallied 23 goals and 49 points, leading the league with five shorthanded goals, Tyler Toffoli is up for a new contract as a restricted free agent. Considering the Kings' financial situation, they could be vulnerable to an offer sheet, because there's lots to like about a 23-year-old who has shown he can score in limited ice time, but the Kings can most likely figure out a way to keep Toffoli in the fold.

Called up midway through the year, when the Kings had finally had enough of Mike Richards, Nick Shore was a solid player in his rookie season, though managed just one goal in 34 games. He had 42 points (20 G, 22 A) in 38 AHL games, so he has some untapped offensive potential, but the 22-year-old needs to get stronger if he's going to take full advantage of his skills.

How the Kings fill out their forward lines will depend, to some degree, on what they do with Richards. If they keep him, they can mix and match with prospects and inexpensive free agent veterans while likely bidding farewell to unrestricted free agents Justin Williams and Jarret Stoll. If the Kings buy out Richards, maybe they have a little more room to be aggressive.

In many circles, Drew Doughty is considered the best defenceman in the league, and when it comes to big games - like the Olympics or Stanley Cup Playoffs - he's right at the forefront of that discussion.

This isn't to say that Doughty isn't excellent, he is, and he played a career-high 28 minutes per game last season, but he doesn't dominate the regular season to the same degree that he has when the Kings have won the Stanley Cup. This is nitpicking, obviously, but is also fair comment to explain why a defenceman of his calibre is still seeking his first Norris Trophy.

Jake Muzzin has worked his way up the Kings depth chart in short order, from a rookie playing third-pair protected minutes in 2012-2013 to logging 22:42 per game and scoring 41 points last season, all the while facing more difficult matchups.

Picked up in a trade with Buffalo during the 2013-2014 season, Brayden McNabb earned a full-time role with the Kings last season, getting more ice time late in the year. The 24-year-old plays a physical game, but is also good enough with the puck to handle a role on the power play.

Coming off his Stanley Cup-winning goal in 2014, Alec Martinez moved into a bigger role for the Kings last season, playing a career-high 19:56 per game. He also missed 26 games due to a finger injury and a concussion, so he didn't have the same impact that he might have in a full season, but Martinez has the chance to play top-four minutes for the Kings.

Veteran punishing defender Matt Greene had more than 200 hits and 125 blocked shots while playing for the league's best possession team. He's a third pairing guy, but his rough and rugged style fits the Kings' mold.

Part of the reason that last season went awry was that uncertain status of defenceman Slava Voynov, a good defenceman who was suspended indefinitely following a domestic violence arrest. That case continues to proceed through the legal system and how it's resolved will determine how the Kings proceed with plans for next season.

If Voynov is cleared to play, then presumably the Kings will find a place for him and hope that he can return to the form he showed prior to last season. If he's not allowed to play, whether through legal and/or immigration issues, then the Kings will have to seek out an alternative like they did last season when they eventually traded for Andrej Sekera. Re-signing Sekera would be a fine way to go, but Voynov's status (and contract) will determine how feasible that may be, because Sekera will be one of the most sought-after free agent defencemen.

Jeff Schultz toiled most of the year in the AHL, but on a one-way contract. He's okay as a seventh defenceman at the NHL level, but may be on the same primarily-AHL plan next season.

Jonathan Quick has been an above-average goaltender whose reputation has been inflated by playoff performances, so while last season's .918 save percentage in a 72-game workload was good, and better than the two seasons that preceded it, Quick needs to perform at a high level to justify the Kings' long-term investment.

25-year-old goalie Martin Jones has a .923 save percentage in 34 career NHL games and while he was only .906 in 15 games last season, the restricted free agent is promising enough that he will attract attention if the Kings are interested in moving him. At the same time, if the Kings can play contract hardball with Jones, they should have a backup at reasonable cost if they want to keep him.
