Ben Affleck all but confirms that he's working with Geoff Johns on the script for the standalone Batman film. "He and I are working together on something and I really am excited about it and I love him."

In a new DC ALL ACCESS episode, the cast and crew of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice discuss their excitement about the upcoming release of the film. However, the most interesting part of the interview comes courtesy of Ben Affleck. The Academy Award winner confirms that he's collaboration with DC Comics Chief Creative Officer Geoff Johns on "something". Could that "something" be the standalone Batman film that Deadline reported was in the works last July. The statements from Affleck certainly line up.

"Geoff Johns is a brilliant guy," said Affleck. "I consider him to be the most valued resource on all things comic book. And every time I like something in a comic I mention, he goes, 'Oh yeah, I wrote that.' Now I just think he's bullsh*tting me, because he says he wrote everything. He and I are working together on something and I really am excited about it and I love him. He's the best."
