Get your a capella version of Dragonborn all sung out now (I know you’re all doing it), Skyrim in Concert is coming!

The first ever orchestral concert dedicated to the music of The Elder Scrolls® V: Skyrim, will premiere at the London Palladium on 16th November. Based on the award winning score by Jeremy Soule, Skyrim in Concert takes concert goers on a nostalgic, musical journey through the landscape of one of The Elder Scrolls’ most popular installments. Performed live by the Winterhold Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir, attendees will enjoy brand new arrangements of some of Skyrim’s most epic and moving themes, including Far Horizons, The Streets of Whiterun and the rousing main theme, Dragonborn, as well as more surprises on the night.

The concert celebrates the upcoming launch of Skyrim Special Edition. Developed by Bethesda Game Studios® and winner of more than 200 Game of the Year Awards, Skyrim Special Edition includes the critically acclaimed game and add-ons with all-new features like remastered art and effects, volumetric god rays, dynamic depth of field, screen-space reflections, and more.
