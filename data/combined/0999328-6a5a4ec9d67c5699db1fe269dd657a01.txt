"Just in case he wins... travel to the U.S. while you're still allowed to!" the airline tweeted on Election Day.

Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, originally proposed a ban on Muslim immigration to the U.S. but has recently scaled back his rhetoric to focus on "extreme vetting" of those who want to enter the U.S.
