Rep. Louie Gohmert says not so fast — John Boehner is the House Speaker now, but that doesn’t necessarily mean he can’t be challenged and that he can’t lose in 2015.

Mr. Gohmert hinted that he might be interested in the job during an interview on “The Steve Malzbert Show” on Newsmax TV.

Asked if he thought Mr. Boehner would keep his leadership role, Mr. Gohmert said: “It’s never over ‘til it’s over,” Newsmax said.

Asked if he were interested in the position himself, Mr. Gohmert said: “I hadn’t planned on it. I’m running for the [Republican Study Committee]. But it’s always good when you have choices,” Newsmax reported.

“One of the things that the people that just poured out to the polls — made clear to everybody but the president — was that they did not want anybody acting outside the bounds of the Constitution,” Mr. Gohmert said, Newsmax reported. “That was very clear to most everybody, but then magically [Obama] was able to hear a message from the people that did not vote, seeming to take that as an indication that they were all for him.”
