On a lonely Friday night in Ripon, cookies rolled down the conveyer belt at Ripon’s main plant.

These were round, soft-baked peanut butter cookies, packaged eight to a container under the name “Smile & Save.”

But few inside the plant were smiling.

As these treats marched through ConAgra’s Ripon West plant on a conveyor belt last week Friday, none followed behind.

They were the last ever produced in Cookietown USA.

The cookie factory, opened in 1930, long has been a staple for the community.

Yet, 85 years later, current owner ConAgra announced last May it would be shutting down the plant.

It meant about 300 employees would lose their jobs; it meant a community known for the scent of cookies baking on a cold winter’s day would close a proud chapter in its history.

ConAgra officials announced production would cease over the winter. Last week, it became clear those final cookies would roll off the line last week Friday.
