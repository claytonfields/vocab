Signed for Getafe today the French midfielder Abdoul Karim Yoda did. And while the player’s famous namesake from George Lucas’ blockbuster once said “Always in motion is the future”, for Yoda, who signed from Romanian side Astra Giurgiu, his future is now clear - two seasons with Getafe, who finished last season in 13th place in the Liga.

Whilst not quite 800 years of training, Yoda has played professionally for much of his career in Switzerland: first with Servette (2006-2009) and later with Sion (2009-2013), where he won the Cup. Last season he played for Romanian side Astra Giurgiu, where the strength of the force within him helped his team to win the Romanian Cup and take second place in the League.

Yoda, who arrived on a free transfer, had his medical this morning wearing a very appropriate t-shirt. He planned to travel to Segovia, an hour north of Madrid, to join the squad for pre-season training.

This is Getafe’s third signing this summer, after bringing in goalkeeper Jona and Colombian midfielder Fredy Hinestroza.
