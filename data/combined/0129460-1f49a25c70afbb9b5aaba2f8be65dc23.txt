CALGARY – With oil prices remaining below $50 a barrel and predictions they could fall even further, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) estimates the energy industry downturn led to over 35,000 layoffs in Alberta’s oilpatch in 2015. CAPP said those cuts include 25,000 in the oil services sector and another 10,000 in exploration and production. Those figures don’t include the thousands of other people who have lost their jobs as the fallout from the oil price collapse continues to impact the province and the country.

There are no hard and fast numbers on the job losses. Alberta employers must reports layoffs of 50 or more people to the provincial government’s ministry of Jobs, Skills, Training and Labour. Between Jan. 1 and mid-November, just over 18,000 workers were let go in group notices.

But countless layoffs involve a handful of employees at small and medium-sized businesses and so fly under the radar. And according to emails to Global News from energy industry workers, some companies are laying off employees in groups of less than 50 in order to avoid reporting the job losses to the provincial government.
