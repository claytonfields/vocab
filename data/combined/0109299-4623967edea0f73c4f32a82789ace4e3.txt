A Voice for Men (AVFM), founded by Paul Elam in the USA, is the worlds largest group dedicated to men’s rights, whereas the Canadian Association For Equality (CAFE) has quickly emerged as the leading men’s issues organization in Canada.

From CAFE’s website: “CAFE is a human rights group that advocates equality for all members of society. Our focus is currently on men and boys because that issue receives much less attention than equal rights for women.” http://equalitycanada.com/

AVfM’s website offers a detailed explanation of their views and goals (http://www.avoiceformen.com/ policies/mission-statement/), which include a radical disagreement with feminist theory and practice, and a belief that “gynocentrism” has been the dominant force in all cultures for millennia.

Please join our live Hangout with Iain Dwyer from CAFE and Paul Elam, founder of AVfM, hosted by Steve Brulé, while we discuss the highlights and achievements of the past year, and explore their different approaches to addressing men’s issues.

You will be able to view the discussion live here via streaming video, or directly on the Studio Brulé YouTube Channel here, on Thursday, December 12, 2013 at 5:00 PM EST, 4:00 Central and 2:00 Pacific.

Bring your insight, most challenging questions, or comments and we will do our best to address as many as we can during this session.

Publisher’s note: I encourage all those interested in men’s rights and issues to put this important discussion on your calendar. Not only will this be a very important exploration of the past year in activism, I will be making an announcement regarding a future event that is groundbreaking. PE
