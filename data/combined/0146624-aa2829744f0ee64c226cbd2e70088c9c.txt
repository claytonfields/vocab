With Copa America and the Olympics both taking place this summer, South America's best footballers have some tough choices to make, since most won't be able to go to both tournaments. On Monday, Lionel Messi announced that he'll be playing in Copa, but skipping the Olympics. Neymar has yet to make an announcement, but it's believed he'll do the opposite, sitting out Copa to prep for trying to win Brazil their first ever gold medal in men's soccer.
