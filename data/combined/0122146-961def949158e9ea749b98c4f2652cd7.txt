There was a time some years ago that CyanogenMod was the surest way to get the latest build of Android on your phone. It's a little slower these days, but development continues to chug along. The CM team hopes to roll out the first nightly builds of CM14.1 later tonight, but not all devices will be supported right away.

According to Steve Kondik, there are about a dozen devices slated for release in the first push. Here they are.

angler (Nexus 6P)

bullhead (Nexus 5X)

cancro (Xiaomi Mi3w/Mi4)

d855 (LG G3)

falcon/peregrine/thea/titan (Moto G variants)

h811/h815 (LG G4)

klte/kltedv/kltespr/klteusc/kltevzw (Samsung Galaxy S5)

oneplus3 (OnePlus 3)

Z00L/Z00T (Zenphone 2)

If you've got one of those devices with an unlocked bootloader, you will be able to install the CM flavor of Nougat. The nightlies will probably have some bugs, but updates will be frequent. Not all features will be available right away, and more devices will get support later. Interested parties with sufficient courage to run a nightly should keep an eye on the CyanogenMod download page.
