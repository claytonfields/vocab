The 2018 Times Higher Education World University Rankings’ table for computer science employs the same rigorous and balanced range of 13 performance indicators used in the overall World University Rankings, but the methodology has been recalibrated to suit the individual fields.

This year’s ranking has expanded to include 300 institutions, up from 100 last year, while the threshold for the proportion of staff working in the relevant disciplines has decreased.

Several newcomers make the list this year. In some cases this is due to the change in the staff threshold. Stanford University, for example, enters at first place, while the University of Cambridge is now in fifth.

Two Swiss institutions – ETH Zurich and EPFL – still make the top 10 this year but both have dropped places, largely as a result of drops in their scores for teaching environment.

Meanwhile, China’s leading institutions – Peking and Tsinghua – have both risen to take 20th (up from 21st) and 25th (up from 27th) place respectively. The National University of Singapore is still top in Asia, despite falling three places to 13th.
