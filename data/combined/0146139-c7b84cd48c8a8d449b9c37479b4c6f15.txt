OSCAR BOYSON:

I'd get off a plane and I'm with somebody who's donating their time and their energy to show me around their city. Their perspective, their energy, their effort is informed just by love and interest, right. So the point of view that they're sharing with me is totally about a citizen. If I hire a production services company in one of these cities, they're going to show me what they think I want to see, right. (37:16) So to have this very pure relationship with the city that I was seeing was really inspiring and a real reminder that cities are about people. They're not about buildings, they're not about cars. People have always made the difference. And feeling that again and again, whether it was someone I met in person or just corresponded with over the internet, was very inspiring.
