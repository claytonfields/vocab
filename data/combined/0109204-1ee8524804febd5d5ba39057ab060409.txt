An internal review has found that an inmate in Kentucky spent five extra months in jail due to human error and possibly computer system issues.

According to The Courier-Journal , David Reyes originally faced felony charges, but pleaded guilty to lesser misdemeanor charges of sexual misconduct, unlawful imprisonment and assault in October 2015.

He received about a one-year sentence with a Sept. 25, 2016 release date, but remained in jail until Feb. 13 when his attorney told a judge he remained imprisoned.

The Louisville Metro Corrections investigation found jail records showed the original felony charges still pending.

A records coordinator noted computer system issues with saving employees' work.

An employee, Jacora Smith, acknowledged inexperience and lack of attention likely made her miss the issue while processing Reyes' release in September 2016.
