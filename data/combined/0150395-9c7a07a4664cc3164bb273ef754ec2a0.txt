During the games, AlphaGo played a handful of highly inventive winning moves, several of which - including move 37 in game two - were so surprising they overturned hundreds of years of received wisdom, and have since been examined extensively by players of all levels. In the course of winning, AlphaGo somehow taught the world completely new knowledge about perhaps the most studied and contemplated game in history.

Since then, AlphaGo has continued to surprise and amaze. In January 2017, an improved AlphaGo version was revealed as the online player "Master" which achieved 60 straight wins in online fast time-control games against top international Go players.



In May 2017, Alpha Go took part in The Future of Go Summit in the birthplace of Go, China, to delve deeper into the mysteries of Go in a spirit of mutual collaboration with the countryâ€™s top players. You can read more about the five day summit here.

Five months later, we received another Nature paper for AlphaGo Zero. Unlike the earlier versions of AlphaGo which learnt how to play the game using thousands of human amateur and professional games, AlphaGo Zero learnt to play the game of Go simply by playing games against itself, starting from completely random play.

In doing so, it surpassed the performance of all previous versions, including those which beat the World Go Champions Lee Sedol and Ke Jie, becoming arguably the strongest Go player of all time.

We believe this new breakthrough has the potential to facilitate major scientific breakthrough and in doing so drastically change the world for the better.
