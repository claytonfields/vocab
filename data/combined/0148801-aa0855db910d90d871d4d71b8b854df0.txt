We have to wait until May 9th for LEGO Dimensions Wave 8 which is a serious bummer, but in the mean time while we wait we can take a look at the recently shared alternate vehicle build images for each of the three upcoming packs.

Wave 8 will include a new Level Pack featuring The Goonies, and two new fun packs Hermione & LEGO City. The release will open two new Adventure Worlds (Goonies & LEGO City). As always each of the new vehicle or gadgets have two alternate builds providing a bunch of new abilities and skills.

You can check out the gallery below or watch our quick video run down of all four new vehicle and their alternate builds!
