Kola Restaurant & Ultra Lounge, Metro Detroit’s premier cultural destination, home to the best of #Afrobeat & #Reggae music, hosts Reggae sensation, ETANA on Friday, May 22, 2015. This special edition of “Tropical Fridays” will feature Reggae music’s spirited and soulful singer/songwriter on the US tour of her chart topping album “I RISE”.

ETANA’s latest album, I Rise recently won World A Reggae’s Album of the Year 2014, and features the hit single Richest Girl. The concert will be hosted by VDJ Wada and opens at 8PM with a performance by Metro Detroit’s own “Uprizin Steel Drum Band”. Since she first came on the scene in 2007 with her debut single, “Wrong Address,” Etana has been one of reggae’s strongest female voices.

It’s easy to see that a lot of care went into the making of this latest offering. There’s hardly a wasted moment to be found on I Rise. Etana has a way of capturing lightening in a bottle while shaking off all pretenses. The instrumentation of strings, percussion, and synth cords works throughout the record as a great complement to Etana’s soul-drenched vocals.

Kola Lounge owner/restauranteur, says we continue to work very hard to establish Kola as a cultural and culinary destination. “Etanas’ management’s selection of Kola as a venue solidifies what we’ve worked so hard to accomplish,” says Dr. Ekpenyong.

Kola’s delectable fare has gone over big with patrons while its elegant selection of wine and spirits satisfy more delicate palates. Domestic and imported beers are also available to go with the lively gnash and entertainment. It’s a big-hearted restaurant that serves food as good as the live entertainment.
