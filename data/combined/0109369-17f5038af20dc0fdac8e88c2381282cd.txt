Allegri to leave Juve in summer?

By Football Italia staff

It is reported that Juventus and Coach Max Allegri could part ways in the summer, with Paulo Sousa a possible replacement.

Gazzetta Dello Sport claim that a number of factors are currently combining to create tension between the Serie A champions and their current boss, who is in his third season in charge in Turin.

These include the former Milan Coach’s anger at his team’s performance in their recent Supercoppa Italiana defeat, perceived disagreements between Allegri and certain member of his squad and the fact the 49-year-old is being linked with the Arsenal job.

The upcoming January transfer window, as well as the eventual outcome of Juventus’ Champions League campaign, are set to be decisive factors in determining whether or not Allegri remains at Juventus Stadium beyond next summer.

According to the Italian daily, Fiorentina Coach Sousa would be Juve’s preferred choice should Allegri depart.

Other names mentioned by the report include Sassuolo’s Eusebio Di Francesco and Monaco’s Leonardo Jardim.

Allegri has won the Italian League and Cup double in each of his two full seasons at the helm, while he also guided the Bianconeri to the 2015 Champions League final.
