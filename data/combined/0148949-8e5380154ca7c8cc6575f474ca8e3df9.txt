Where's My Brother?

Help us find a 69 year old man taken at birth!

This website is dedicated to helping find an infant who was taken at birth in 1944!

We will be continually posting information that may help locate or identify the individual or maybe some of his current family members. He may not even be aware that he was taken as a baby.

This happened in Detroit, MI and the doctor who allegedly took him from his mother and father has since passed away. Both parents were deaf and mute and it was an interratial marriage which was rare in those days.

Posted here are pictures of the family to help you identify and check for a family resemblance.

The mother is currently 100 years old and the sister is trying desperately to find her brother before the mother passes.

Can you help? Know someone in the media who might carry the story?

He was born in Michigan so maybe you know a government official there?

Additional information:

Even though the birth certificate says the father was "negro" and the mother too, you can tell by the pictures he was actually caucasian. That was so the they could have the baby in a negro hospital. Think back in those days about the prejudice and how things were different than today. Imagine not being able to hear or speak and someone taking your baby. Amazing things have happened in regards to finding people after decades have passed.
