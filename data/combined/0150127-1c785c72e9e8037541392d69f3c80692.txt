What words come to mind when you hear the word Prada? Could it be fashion, luxury…chocobos? Be sure to add that last one to your list.

Square Enix has teamed up with the Italian clothing brand to turn some of its recent characters into fashion models. Characters from Final Fantasy XIII and XIII-2 games such as Lightning, Snow, and Sazh will showcase Prada’s 2012 Spring and Summer men’s collection in the next issue of Arena Homme+ fashion magazine.

“I’ve always been interested by the power of videogames and their place in society, and the amount of work that’s gone into this project blows my mind,” editor of Arena Homme+ Max Pearmain said. “We’re incredibly pleased with the result.”

The character models were developed by Square Enix’s world leading Visual Works studio in Japan. They will be featured in a 12-page spread in the magazine out April 12.
