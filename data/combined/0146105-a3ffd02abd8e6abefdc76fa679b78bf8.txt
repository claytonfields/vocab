The Australian parliament has launched an inquiry into the pricing of digitally distributed content.

In spite of fewer distribution costs, digitally downloaded games and music are sometimes priced in Australia (and New Zealand) as if they were physically shipped.

The politicians behind the inquiry, including the Minister for Communications, Stephen Conroy, hope that the publicity generated by the inquiry will cause companies to better align the price of digital content with markets such as the United States and Europe, reports the Sydney Morning Herald.

“There is evidence to suggest that the innovative use of technology is not always matched with innovative new business models in the case of products and services distributed online,” reads a letter from Mr Conroy to Sydney MP Ed Husic [via SMH].

“I agree that Australian businesses and households should have access to IT software and hardware that is fairly priced relative to other jurisdictions … the global digital economy is likely to make it increasingly difficult to sustain business models that are based on a geographic carve-up of markets.”

Gameplanet has contacted New Zealand’s Minister for Communications and Information Technology, Ms Amy Adams, inquiring as to whether the New Zealand government will consider a similar investigation. This article will be updated upon the Minister's reply.
