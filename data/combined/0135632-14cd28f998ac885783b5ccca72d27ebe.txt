The King of Wakanda is coming to All-New, All-Different Marvel.

As Marvel Comics revealed today, a new Black Panther series will hit comic shelves when the company launches its latest publishing initiative this fall. Marvel Editor-in-Chief Axel Alonso broke the news during an interview with Mass Appeal, while also confirming that more unannounced All-New, All-Different Marvel titles are on the horizon.

"All-New Marvel Now! is a campaign where there are new #1s across the board – from Spider-Man to Squirrel Girl to stuff we haven’t announced yet, like Black Panther," Alonso told Mass Appeal.

When asked for verification, Marvel confirmed with ComicBook.com that a new Black Panther series is indeed in the works. While a creative team and release date are still under wraps, it’s likely that Marvel will formally announce the title closer to the November 2015 comics solicitation deadline. Earlier today, Marvel exclusively revealed more information on their latest All-New, All-Different title, “Spidey,” with ComicBook.com
