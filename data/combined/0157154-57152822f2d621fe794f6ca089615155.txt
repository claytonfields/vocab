Washington Wizards forward Markieff Morris, who had surgery in late September to repair a sports hernia, says he's ready to make his season debut this week.

"I feel like I'm ready to play," Morris told reporters Tuesday.

The team had forecast that Morris would miss six to eight weeks.

"We're just going through protocol," Morris said. "Everybody's body is different. Mine, I feel like it healed a little faster than normal and I'm just ready to go now."

Upon being activated, Morris still must serve a one-game suspension for leaving the bench during Friday's altercation between Bradley Beal and Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green.

The Wizards have upcoming games against Phoenix (Wednesday), Cleveland (Friday) and Toronto (Sunday).

Morris, 28, averaged a career-high 14.0 points and 6.5 rebounds last season for Washington, which lost to Boston in the second round of the playoffs.
