The disingenuous and quite insane backlash against the International Conference on Men’s Issues has produced some interesting results. First, the onslaught of yellow journalism from places like Daily Kos and the Huffington Post has been unprecedented, even for those two myth-factories.

The other thing it has produced is a hell of a lot more interest in the conference, and more ticket sales. So much so, as a matter of fact, that we have opted to move to a venue that will seat more people and provide more security than was available previously.

While we apologize for any inconvenience that the move is going to cause, it is nonetheless a positive move for the conference. Because seating capacity was misrepresented to us at the previous venue, we were forced to plan for an overflow room where we would pipe in live events to a monitor at reduced ticket prices.

With the change of venue we will be able to accommodate all attendees in the same space at the same time.

An auspicious place for a conference on men’s issue to occur, VFW Post 1146 Walter F Bruce at 28404 Jefferson Avenue will serve as an appropriate setting to observe and discuss the issues facing men and boys in modern culture.

We hope you will join us there to begin a new era of how we discuss matters of sex, gender and power, with compassion for all human beings and in interest in solving all problems people face, not just those selected for us by modern gender ideologues.

We will be posting more details on this in the near future.
