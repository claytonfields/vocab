LAHORE (APP) â€“ Veteran film, stage and TV star Irfan Khosat Friday said that there was shortage of good story-writers in Pakistani film industry.

In the past, the Indians used to copy Pakistani films, he said talking to APP here.

He said that he did not believe in quantity rather in quality, while signing the films. He said that there was no dearth of talent in Pakistan and the recently released hit films had proved it.

A film director used to be captain of the film in the past, but now the film producers try to dictate his viewpoint in every department of film, which badly affected the standard of movie, he added.

He suggested the producers not to interfere in every department of film without technical knowledge in the best interest of the movies.
