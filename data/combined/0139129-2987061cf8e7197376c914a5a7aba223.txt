There have been rumors for weeks, now the fight appears to be coming together.

WBC light heavyweight champion Adonis Stevenson (27-1, 22 KOs) will likely defend his title in a rematch with Andrzej Fonfara (28-3, 16 KOs), according to information provided by Stevenson's promoter Yvon Michel to TVA Sports.

The fight could take place on a date in May in Montreal or June in Toronto.

They first met in 2014, with Fonfara getting hurt early in the fight and going down twice. But he shook off the cobwebs and came back in the second half to hurt and drop Stevenson.

Since their first meeting, Stevenson retained his title three times. He knocked out Dmitry Sukhotsky in five rounds, won a twelve round unanimous decision over Sakio Bika and knocked out Tommy Karpency in three rounds.

For his part, Fonfara found a lot of success with three big wins of his own. He won a ten round decision over Doudou Ngumbu, knocked out the 'Son of a Legend' Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. in nine rounds last April, and then came back in October to win a twelve round decision over former WBO champion Nathan Cleverly in a 'Fight of The Year' candidate.

Both Stevenson and Fonfara are advised by Al Haymon. The winner would have to make a mandatory defense against undefeated Eleider Alvarez, who is also advised by Haymon and promoter by Michel's company GYM.
