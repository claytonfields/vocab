New BrickHeadz confirmed for 2018 Posted by Huw, 05 Oct 2017 09:57

Our friends over at Jedi News are at the New York Comic Con and have sent us a photo of a poster that confirms we'll be seeing more BrickHeadz next year:

January : Four Justice League and two Star Wars

: Four Justice League and two Star Wars April: Two Star Wars and four Avengers

They are numbered from 21: I'm guessing that's to indicate that they are second year models.

I'll let you have fun speculating who they might be by examining the silhouettes.

Thanks to Matt for the picture.
