A Taunton woman arrested Monday afternoon on drunk driving charges was carrying a lizard in her bra, police said.

Amy Rebello-McCarthy, 39, veered off the road and struck half a dozen mailboxes before crashing onto a lawn, police said. When police arrived around 1:30 p.m., Rebello-McCarthy slurred her words as she asked officers to call a tow truck. All four tires were flat, the airbags had been deployed, and the bumpers were missing, police said.

When police searched her car, they found an open bottle of brandy in the front seat along with empty bottles of root beer-flavored nips, police said.

Rebello-McCarthy’s blood alcohol content was measured at nearly twice the legal limit, police said.

A 22-year-old Waltham man, Martin Kyewalyanga, was in the passenger seat when the car crashed, witnesses told police. While police were talking to Rebello-McCarthy, Kyewalyanga was smoking a cigarette near the back of the car, where gasoline was dripping. Police asked him to step away from the vehicle, fearing that he might start a fire.

Kyewalyanga was placed under arrest for his own safety because he was so inebriated, police said.

As she was arrested, Rebello-McCarthy told police officers that she was carrying a bearded dragon in her bra. The lizard was placed “in a red bandana for safe keeping,” police wrote in their report.

“It faces no charges at this time,” police wrote in a Facebook post that had some fun at Rebello-McCarthy’s expense.

She has been arraigned 109 times in her adult life, police said.

“You can’t make this stuff up,” police wrote in the post.
