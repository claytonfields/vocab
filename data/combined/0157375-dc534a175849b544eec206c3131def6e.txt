Historical Models

Spoiler Video from last week's HB61

[DIsclaimer: this HB was the first time we're using arty, the mod changes the way arty works, you can either direct fire, or shoot long range by aiming on the minimap, the satellite arty view has been blacked out]













Same battle from ISU pov



This topic contains models created for Historical Battles,Because the emphasis is on usage in HB, models may seem 'unfinished'. For example crash models are unused in HB, so the mods don't contain any.I might fix this in the future, but it's low on the priority list.Any other historical vehicles you'd like to see? Post your suggestions hereWhat are Historical Battles? We run weekly training room events of historical tanks on Sunday evenings. Furthermore, we run games with a realism mod, the 'Historical Realism Mod'.If you're interested in realistic/historical looking models, chances are you'd love HB, sign up for an upcoming battle or read more at: http://forum.worldof...orical-battles/ A picture is worth a thousand words, and 30fps video is.. just watch it:
