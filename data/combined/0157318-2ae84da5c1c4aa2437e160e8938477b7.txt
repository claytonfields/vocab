Stranger In A Strange Land

As the heavens are in continual motion, so be the events on our planet. Energy ebbs and flows, some of us fight the current and some of us flow with it. Some of us know there are times when it is best to let the flow carry us, and other times when it is best to fight against it. Our lives are in continual adjustment to the forces outside of us and within us.

The key seems to be: know when to fight the current and know when to let it carry you…

Our friend Mr. Snowden currently seeks temporary asylum in Russia as he awaits transport to the southern hemisphere. The US media continues NOT to report on the abuses by the NSA. They are leaving this up to the Brits, and Glen Greenwald writing for the Guardian, see the NSA files. A plane crash at the San Francisco Airport, with many mixed messages; pilot error or mechanical malfunction, a young woman thrown from the plane in the crash, then run over by Airport emergency vehicles, it remains unclear which event caused her death; what strange, sad events these be.

Most likely the strangeness will continue this coming week. Beginning on Monday July 15, we have the First Quarter Moon. The Sun Filters the Rays of Cancer (Cardinal-Water) and Moon Filters the Rays of Libra (Cardinal-Air); this lunation is connected to the Lunar Eclipse on October 18, 2013; events that happen this week, will be connected to events occurring at the Lunar Eclipse in October, and will specifically affect the Cardinal Signs of Aries, Cancer, Libra, and Capricorn. The degrees 22-26, will feel the energy most intensely.

But the really big news this week will happen on Wednesday, July 17, 2013. On this day the Sky God, Uranus(Ouranos), Stations Retrograde in Aries. This literally means if one is visually tracking the planet Uranus in the night sky, it appears to stop in its orbital path, and reverse motion. On the day a planet stations, the energy is at its most intense. Uranus is a highly erratic, and highly electrical energy, it is associated with completely unexpected events, which seemingly come out of nowhere, like a lightening bolt out of the blue. It is also associated with intuitive flashes of brilliance; many great inventors have a prominent Uranus in their natal chart.

Uranus is also the HIGHER OCTAVE OF MERCURY. And the Winged Messenger Stations Direct on Saturday, July 20 in Cancer. To add fuel to these already intense energies at play, these two planets are in a square configuration this week. Uranus at 12 Aries, squares Mercury at 13 Cancer. Think of 90 degree angles representing obstacles and impediments on our path. Both of these planets are changing direction this week, one direct, the other retrograde; their energies are very similar in nature, affecting electricity, communication, travel, and they are both in Cardinal Signs (indicating Action). This configuration will greatly increase the odd and unusual events that often occur during a Mercury station.

On the positive side, pay attention to brilliant flashes of INTUITION and knowing that enlightens and moves us further along on our path of evolution and widens the spectrum of consciousness.

The other event occurring on this day is the Grand Water Trine, that has been floating around the heavens, will come into exact. The greater benefic, Jupiter at 5 degrees Cancer (Cardinal-Water), Saturn at 5 degrees Scorpio (Fixed-Water), and Neptune at 5 degrees Pisces (Mutable-Water), form a Grand Water Trine and exuberance, emotions, and illusions will flow. A Trine represents a Triangle and the energy flows, and flows and flows….And as the Moon is in Scorpio on this day, the only energy in the Earth Element is Pluto.

So be optimistic and reach for the Stars, but remember to STAY GROUNDED. Hug a Tree, plant some flowers, take your shoes off and stand on the grass, dirt, sand, connect directly with the beautiful, earthy energy of GAIA.

The Sabian Symbol for the First Quarter Moon on July 15, 2013:

(Libra 24) A BUTTERFLY WITH A THIRD WING ON ITS LEFT SIDE

[KEYNOTE: The ability to develop, for inner strengthening, new modes of response to basic life situations.] (Rudhyar)

___________________________________________________________________________________

And considering the energies in play this week, we all may be called to develop new modes of response to situations in our lives.

It will not be easy to go with the flow this week, neither will it be easy to swim against it. Emotions will be all over the place.

The best thing to do is find the Center of You..…the solid center of the Heart, connected to Spirit, The Universe, Love.

PAY ATTENTION

BE PRESENT

As always, Stay in your HEART…

In Love & Light,
