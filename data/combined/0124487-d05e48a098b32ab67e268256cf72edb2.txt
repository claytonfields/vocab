It was due to be published in January, following on from the conclusion of the Infinity event/crossover. Inhuman #1, by Matt Fraction and Joe Madureira is, as it was when we broke the story, intended to revitalise and revamp the Inhumans.

No longer a ghettoised group, they were to spread across the globe, grown in number by the release worldwide of Terrigen Mists and a richer, deeper history to the super-powered strain of humanity revealed. Describes as a Game Of Thrones style of storytelling. The overarching term for the affected comics was Inhumanity – the first such labelled book, Avengers Assemble, was published today.

There is talk that Inhuman #1 will set the scene for an Inhumans Marvel Studios movie, fulfilling the role with the Studio that the X-Men is unable to, due to deals with Fox.

But the main book, Inhuman #1, has been postponed by Marvel. Labelled “cancelled” on Diamond Comic Distributors schedule, it will instead be published again at a later date, and retailers will most likely be asked to order the book again.

Joe Madureira is notoriously an artist who takes his time on the book, but I have been told by Marvel representatives that there are a number of reasons for this decision. But for it to be postponed rather than simply delayed may indicate something rather serious.

So distract from all that, here’s some art from a book that actually is coming out in January, All New Marvel Now Point One.
