Porsche #918 of 918 units has been built. The last one.

If you had plans to buy a brand new Porsche 918 Spyder, you’d better hurry because Porsche has just built its last unit. According to The Telegraaf, the last Porsche 918 Spyder rolled off the assembly line earlier yesterday (June. 18, 2015) and its burgundy. All in all, its been 21 months since the Porsche 918 was put into production. Porsche has been working around the clock to produce the number of units planned within a reasonable amount of time. To make one, it takes the work of exactly 100 specialists about 100 man hours from start to finish. On average, that works out to be about 1.4 Porsche 918’s built everyday.

There are still plenty of Porsche 918s left to buy, it’s just that you’ll have to secure your spot in line.According to Porsche, it’s on a first come, first serve basis. That means you’ll have your pick of the available Porsche 918’s and don’t have to take necessarily the next one that comes off the assembly line. Porsche released some interesting figures attached to sales so far. For example, did you know that 30 percent of all Porsche 918 sales so far have gone to Americans? That works out to 297 units that have landed on American soil (leave some for the rest of the world, why don’t you!)

The Porsche 918 is a tour-de-force that honestly only comes around once in a lifetime. Like a lot of the other examples coming out at this golden age of supercars, it’s a hybrid. That means technically with the battery power available, it can run 12 miles on electricity alone. But those batteries are for strictly for performance and when tied to its power unit (internal combustion engine), there’s a combined 887 HP and 944 lbs-ft of torque available. That’s courtesy of a 4.6 L V8 and two electric motors on the front and rear axle paired to a seven-speed PDK. MSRP for this German hybrid? $847, 975. Better bring your Visa Black Card. And just for old times sake and to lament the fact that the Nurburgring is closed to any future lap records (as this goes to “print”) here’s the 918 straight whipping it around the ‘Ring.
