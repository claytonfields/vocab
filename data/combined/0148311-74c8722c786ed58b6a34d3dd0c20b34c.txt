My secret santa kicked ass and took names! She got me the badest Christmas shirt I've ever seen, 2 pair of socks to match, an awesome Nuka Cola blanket (it's even round like a bottle cap!), some chocolates, and sent me an adorable card with a hand written note. She, also, sent me (which got me teary eyed)...an Ash vs. Evil Dead pin set she got at the Ash vs. Evil Dead panel when she went to Comicon!!!!!!!!!! I expressed my love for Bruce Campbell, and it turns out she loves him, too. I cannot believe you gave me these pins. It was seriously sweet of you to do that. You're one awesome woman. Big giant groovy hugs and a groovy Christmas to you!!!!!!!! Thank you from the bottom of my heart. You really are the bestest, and I wish we lived closer to each other as well!! I cannot thank you enough. I hope you have the best holiday ever!!!
