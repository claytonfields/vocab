Web discovery service StumbleUpon has just overtaken Facebook as the No. 1 source for social media traffic in the U.S., according to analytics site Statcounter. StumbleUpon accounted for about 43% of the U.S. social media traffic on January 1st, while Facebook accounted for about 38%.

Statcounter tracks 15 billion page views on the Web per month on more than three million websites. Among social media sites, it tracks the top seven: StumbleUpon, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, YouTube, Myspace and Digg. Just last year during the same period, StumbleUpon made up 30% of the traffic, while Facebook had 48%. But, as a recent Atlantic article reported, the growth in online sharing with StumbleUpon outpaced Facebook in 2010.

What's interesting is how StumbleUpon's comparatively smaller user base -- 13 million compared to Facebook's 500 million -- generates more traffic than Facebook's. It's important to note, however, that StumbleUpon may generate a lot of traffic for other websites, but that does not necessarily mean it gets a lot of traffic for its own. In fact, Facebook recently beat Google as most visited website worldwide.

StumbleUpon founder and chief Garrett Camp wrote about the news on his Twitter account earlier.
