The governor of Maine attacked the press earlier this week and accused reporters of spreading false information that he threatened to go on vacation during a government shutdown, but a new recording of a voicemail captures him mentioning the vacation.

Gov. Paul LePage (R) accused the press of writing false news stories about him going on a 10-day vacation during the shutdown earlier this week, saying that he actually said his pen was going on vacation because he had nothing to sign.

“I said, ‘My pen’s on vacation, I have nothing to do.’ And that meant that I was on vacation,” LePage said.

But in a voicemail that the Portland Press Harold obtained from a public records request, LePage is heard telling state Sen. Roger Katz (R) that he would be on vacation for 10 days.

“I’m heading out of town for about 10 days, and I would like to speak to you before I leave,” LePage is heard saying in the recording.

Reporters originally covered his statement about going on vacation along with his comments suggesting that he makes up fake news stories to mislead reporters.

“I just love to sit in my office and make up ways so they’ll write these stupid stories because they are just so stupid, it’s awful,” LePage said in the original interview.
