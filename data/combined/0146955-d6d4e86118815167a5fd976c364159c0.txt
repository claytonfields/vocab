Washington (CNN) Hillary Clinton leads Donald Trump across the board in a new poll of battleground states.

Her leads held at nearly the same margins when Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson was included in the poll. And Clinton led Trump 48% to 37% when all states were factored together. With Johnson included, Clinton led Trump 44% to 34%, with Johnson at 13%.

Amid long-shot efforts by a handful of delegates to name someone other than Trump as the GOP nominee, Ballotpedia also polled Clinton against Ohio Gov. John Kasich and House Speaker Paul Ryan. Kasich had a slight lead on Clinton and Ryan polled neck-and-neck.

Separate polling in three battleground states, conducted by Quinnipiac University , found a much tighter race: Clinton up 8 points in Florida, but only 1 point in Pennsylvania and a tie in Ohio.

Each of the seven states surveyed is seen as a swing state where either party is normally seen as relatively competitive in presidential elections, though Michigan has gone Democratic in most recent presidential elections.

Ballotpedia surveyed roughly 600 voters in each of the states between June 10-22 for the poll and each survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.

A Quinnipiac University national poll released Wednesday shows Hillary Clinton leading Trump by just two points, 42% to 40%, a much closer race than other recent surveys have shown. With third-party candidates included, Clinton leads 39% to 37%, with Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson at 8% and Green Party candidate Jill Stein at 4%.

This Quinnipiac poll is quite different from other recent surveys on the presidential race, showing a much tighter contest than others. Its field period overlaps with those of the Washington Post/ABC News and NBC News /Wall Street Journal polls released Sunday, both of which found Clinton significantly ahead of Trump.
