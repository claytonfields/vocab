The debate over funding for the Homeland Security Department wasn’t the only thing that froze over in the Senate Thursday

Sen. Jim Inhofe, who chairs the Environment and Public Works Committee, tossed a snowball on the Senate floor as part of a speech expressing skepticism about the reality of climate change. The Oklahoma Republican opened by showing pictures of an igloo his daughter’s family built during a snowstorm five years ago, when he said “the hysteria on global warming” began.

Then Inhofe reached into a bag he had brought with him and pulled out a robust snowball.

“Do you know what this is? It’s a snowball,” he said to freshman Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, who being from Louisiana may not be familiar with snow. “It’s just from outside here, so it’s very, very cold out, … very unseasonable.”

“Mr. President, Catch this,” Inhofe said before tossing the snowball underhand. An Inhofe aide said it was caught by a page.
