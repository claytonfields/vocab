RENO, NV - A Washoe County Sheriff's deputy who struck and killed a bicyclist on Lemmon Drive in July pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges Friday morning in Reno Justice Court.

Deputy Mathew Durham was sentenced to 30 days in jail and community service for causing injuries that led to the death of 21-year-old Kevin Albertson of Reno .

Albertson died after he was hit by Durham's 2010 Chevrolet Tahoe in the eastbound lane in July. Investigators say Durham was on-duty and was driving to a call without lights or siren when he struck the Albertson.

Durham has been with the sheriff's office for five years. Albertson's family has said they they did not want Durham to be sentenced for a long period of time. However, they have said they expect to file a lawsuit in civil court.
