Ah, baking, an essential part of my cooking repertoire. However, sweets and baking, I am not good at. This week, I decided to try my hand at baking cookies from scratch. I wanted to make sâ€™mores like cookie, a graham cracker flavored cookie stuffed with a chocolate and marshmallow gooey center. Sounds delicious right? I think it would have been if I could have gotten the marshmallows to actually stay gooey instead of just burning away and melting into the cookie. The cookie itself was yummy though!

While I was at it, I decided to bake some cookie stuffed cookies! People seem to really like these. They are quite a treat, and I only recommend eating 1. I present Oreos stuffed into chocolate chip cookies.

Like all cookies, these are best right out of the oven with some milk. Yum!

Bonus! I baked some chicken pot pie and a veggie pot pie for dinner.
