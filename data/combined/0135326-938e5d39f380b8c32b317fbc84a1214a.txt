Kumar Vishwas, an Aam Aadmi Party leader whose name is doing the rounds as the candidate Arvind Kejriwal might field against Congress number 2 Rahul Gandhi in the Lok Sabha elections, has dared the BJP to make it a three-cornered fight by fielding Narendra Modi."If Modi really wants to end Rahul Gandhi's reign in Amethi, let him contest from there. Or then field (BJP president) Rajnath Singh from there. Let Rahul Gandhi, Modi and me contest from Amethi and see who wins," Mr Vishwas, a 43-year-old poet said.Mr Modi is the BJP's prime ministerial candidate and the general elections due by May are widely seen as a direct contest between him and Mr Gandhi, though the Congress has not formally named its vice president as its candidate for PM yet.Mr Gandhi contests elections from Amethi, a Gandhi bastion, in Uttar Pradesh. After his party's spectacular debut in the Delhi elections, Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal had announced that his year-old party would also contest the national elections and could field Mr Vishwas against the Congress leader.BJP chief Rajnath Singh is the Lok Sabha MP from Ghaziabad, where Mr Kejriwal lives.In the recently held Delhi elections Mr Kejriwal defeated former Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit by a massive margin. His AAP won 28 seats, the second highest tally, and agreed to form government after single largest party the BJP declined, saying it did not have the numbers. With 28 legislators, Mr Kejriwal runs a minority government, with the external support of eight Congress MLAs.
