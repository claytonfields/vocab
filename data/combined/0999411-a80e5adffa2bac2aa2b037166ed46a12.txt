This is the full 4-1-13 episode of the Labor Express Radio program.

In Pilsen, a working class, Mexican immigrant on Chicago’s Southside, Metro Bank has been foreclosing on several apartment buildings and has been attempting to evict the building’s tenants. But little did Metro Bank know that at least two of their tenants were seasoned activists and members of the IWW (The Industrial Workers of the World). And like good Wobblies, these tenants didn’t simple mourn the banks attempts to evict them - they organized! They communicated with friends and neighbors at several buildings in the community that were taken over by Metro Bank and are fighting back. On Friday about two dozen tenants and their supporters held a rally outside Metro Bank in east Pilsen. We will hear what they had to say on today’s program.

And we have a very special in studio guest this morning. Oscar Chacon- Executive Director of the National Alliance of Latin American & Caribbean Communities (NALACC), is here to talk about developments in the debates over immigration reform in the U.S. and about an exciting event being held next Saturday here in Chicago called Latino Nation.
