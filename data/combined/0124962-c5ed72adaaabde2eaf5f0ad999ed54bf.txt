Battling ‘the 1%’ : Occupy Wall Street

Several hundred protestors were arrested over the weekend in New York as the Occupy Wall Street (OWS) Campaign gathered momentum. The movement, which started as a protest outside the city’s Stock Exchange, condemns economic inequality and the influence of lobbyists and corporations on the government.

Bound by the slogan ‘We Are The 99%’, demonstrators are seeking to battle the corporate greed of ‘the 1%’ and are increasingly capturing the attention of both the international press and the American public. Influenced by the non-violent tactics of the revolutionary Arab Spring, the OWS campaign is spreading to other cities across the United States.

Whilst most political commentators agree that the corruption and financial malpractices leading to the global economic downturn must be tackled, analytical opinion of the OWS resistance has been both for and against.

John Avlon, a senior columnist at The Daily Beast , fundamentally views OWS as a lost opportunity, arguing that as ‘a policy-free event’ it offers no tangible answers. ‘These protestors have the trappings of anarchists with Apple Computers’, he writes. ‘They are earnest and know how to play for the cameras. They have internalized slogans that capture emotions but are too often unrelated to solutions.’

Other reports have been more sympathetic. Writing for the Guardian, David Graeber analyses OWS as the result of ‘colossal social failure,‘ rooted in ‘obvious reasons’. Graeber brings to attention the hesitance of protestors to recognise ‘the legitimacy of the politicians against whom they are ranged,’ interpreting the lack of the policy-specific demands as a deliberate move.
