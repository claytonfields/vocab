The official website for the Gundam Build Fighters anime announced on Thursday that a new series is in the works. The website gives no further details — or even state that the new series will be anime — other than the phrase, "GUNPLA BATTLE NEXT FIGHTERS STANDBY."

The story is set in the near future when Gunpla Battles, competitions that pit Gundam plastic models against each other, have become popular worldwide in the "Second Gunpla Boom." Sei Iori, a first-year middle-school student and the only son of a model shop owner, is talented at building Gunpla, but inexperienced in the Gunpla Battles. He encounters a mysterious boy named Reiji who happens to be an accomplished Gundam Fighter. Together, they strive for the Gunpla Battle world championships.

The Gundam Build Fighters anime premiered last October, and Sunrise streamed the series in the United States and Canada as it aired in Japan.
