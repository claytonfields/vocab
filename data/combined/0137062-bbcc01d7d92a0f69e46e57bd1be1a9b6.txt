Citi Field Seating Chart/Seat Map Details

We take great care in providing the most accurate seating charts/seat maps because we understand how crucial they are to choosing the right event. We try to also provide you with seat views that show you what kind of view you can expect from different parts of the venue. You can go to our Citi Field seat views page to see them. Citi Field can hold up to 41,800 people but that's a lot of seats and therefore a lot of potential seat views. We wish we had all 41,800 individual seat views for Citi Field but we don't, therefore the seat views we show are usually a sample from different sections in a venue.

Every seating chart/seat map at Citi Field can be a little different, therefore it's probably a good idea to double check you're looking at the one that matches the event you're attending. If not, you can always choose a different seating chart from the list above.

That's all we've got on seating charts but you can always browse events in New York by visiting one of the following pages:
