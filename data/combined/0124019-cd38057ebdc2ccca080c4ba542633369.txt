As chairman of the National Hockey League’s board of governors, Bruins owner Jeremy Jacobs has had many a clash with the players’ union over the years. Now, he’s apparently backing a mayoral candidate known for his union credentials.

Jacobs and his three sons, who own the Buffalo-based food service and hospitality conglomerate Delaware North, as well as their spouses, made a $13,000 donation to Mayor Marty Walsh’s reelection bid, following a fundraiser held at TD Garden, also owned by the Jacobs family. As the Globe notes, this is their largest ever political contribution to a candidate in Massachusetts, after stiffing Walsh’s predecessor, the late Tom Menino, for the latter half of his 20-year reign.

The Jacobs family has enjoyed an amicable relationship with City Hall during Walsh’s first term. Last fall, the city inked a three-year deal with a Delaware North subsidiary to program events at City Hall Plaza, starting with the wildly popular Boston Winter. Bruins CEO Charlie Jacobs, Jeremy’s son, was among the biggest donors to Boston 2024, Walsh’s failed Olympic bid, while TD Garden president Amy Latimer also publicly supported the effort.
