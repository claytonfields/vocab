BROWNSVILLE, Texas -- A county employee is accused of intercepting deliveries of fajitas and selling them to his own customers for the past nine years, reports say.

That adds up to more than $1.2 million in fajitas over the years, and now Gilberto Escaramilla has been arrested on a first-degree felony charge of theft, the Brownsville Herald reports.

"If it wasn't so serious, you'd think it was a 'Saturday Night Live' skit. But this is the real thing," District Attorney Luis V. Saenz tells the Herald.

Reports say Escaramilla's scheme was exposed in August when he took a day off work for a medical appointment. While gone, a truck arrived attempting to deliver 800 pounds of fajitas to the Cameron County Juvenile Justice Department.

This raised alarms as the justice department doesn't serve fajitas, kurv.com reports.

Confronted the next day, Escaramilla admitted he had been stealing fajitas for the past nine years, the Herald reports. He was fired from his job.

Officials obtained a search warrant for Excaramilla's home and found packets of fajitas in his refrigerator, reports say.
