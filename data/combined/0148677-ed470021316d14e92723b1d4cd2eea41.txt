Fans of classics SEGA video games should remember the Space Harrier franchise well. Space Harrier helped to kick off the early “on-rails” shooter genre, where you moved in a pre-determined direction and blasted everything in your way. Space Harrier itself is relegated to the obscure 80’s relics pile these days, so seeing official product for it is very rare. RC Berg, Ltd is going to give fans of the classic game a chance at a few cool collectibles. They have announced two Space Harrier 3D – Scaled Resin Model Kits. They are releasing a 1/12 scale Harrier, the protagonist from the game as well as the mysterious IDA, the stone faced enemies from the game. IDA will be 1/24 scale.

The hero, Harrier will include two bonus accessories. These include a smaller Harrier figure, which is roughly the same scale as the Ida model kit. You will also get a second hair sculpt. The alternate hair is meant to match the Space Harrier’s arcade poster. Harrier requires assemble, but is pre-painted. IDA requires very little assemble. That kit can function not only as a scaled enemy for Harrier, but also as a pen/pencil cup. IDA includes a small sitting Harrier.

Pre-orders for these are live now and run until June 25th, with a release scheduled for July. Harrier is priced at 10,584 Yen with tax included (about $96 USD). IDA is priced at 9,720 Yen with tax included (about $88 USD). Check out the photos by reading on.
