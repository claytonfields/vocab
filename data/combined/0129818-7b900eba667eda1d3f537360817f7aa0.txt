Second mapset based on my Christmas traditions survey: what kind of soup do you eat on Christmas Eve? This time people were allowed multiple answers so some places might have the most intense colors in more than one category.

It seems that beetroot soup is the most popular countrywide and present nearly everywhere, although mushroom soup and fish soup are quite popular regionally as well. Mushroom soup seems to be Christmas tradition mostly in central Poland which surprises me because there are no major woods there and mushrooms generally grow in woods. Fish soup on the other hand is popular in former Prussian territories. There is also the “other” soup category, where most of answers include fruit soup or suss which I believe is pretty much the same.
