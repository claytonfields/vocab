Monday kicks off the final week of longtime New York drive-time radio host Mike Francesa on WFAN.

One thing his legions of fans will miss is the unintentional comedy that came up on his show over the years. That’s bound to happen when it’s one host in a studio with some wacky callers or — for a while — a simulcast.

Here are some of those unintentionally hilarious moments:

1. Whenever he called live sporting events on the air

Like the Jalen Adams shot in 2016.

2. The way he dealt with weird questions from callers

3. That time he cut off an on-air proposal from a caller

4. The “Al Albuquerque” gaffe

A recap: Back in 2011, a caller ask Francesa about a Tigers reliever whose name was really Al Albuquerque. The host thought he was being pranked, but then backtracked when he realized it wasn’t a caller trying to get him.

5. The now-famous rant on being a great snowblower

6. His rants about non-sports topics like the death of Harambe the gorilla

From 2016:

“Can you imagine if that was your child in there? You’re going to have people who are going to say, ‘Wait a second, I’m worried about the gorilla?’ When your kid’s in there, basically, maybe seconds from having his head crushed? We live in a world now where you are going to be more concerned with the gorilla than you are the little boy? What is wrong with you people!?”

7. “PUT MY MIC ON!”

8. That time he spilled his beloved Diet Coke on a broadcast

9. Last but not least: The time he once slept on the air
