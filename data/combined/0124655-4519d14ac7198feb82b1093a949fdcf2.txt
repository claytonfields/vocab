In continuing their “Unlimited” campaign, which pays homage to both everyday athletes and the champion athletes who regularly push their limits and who are poised to prove their unlimited potential this summer and beyond, Nike presents a new Olympic ad, “Unlimited Youth.” The delivery acts as a followup to the brand’s previous “Unlimited Courage,” “Unlimited You” and “Unlimited Together” films.

This time around the Swoosh is celebrating an extraordinary athlete, Sister Madonna Buder, and her determination to defy conventional conceptions of age. At the age of 65, Sister Buder completed her first IRONMAN World Championship triathlon in Hawaii, before going on to become the oldest woman to ever complete an IRONMAN triathlon, at age 75. From there, the American nun set a world record as the oldest IRONMAN triathlon competitor when she was 82 years old. Now at the age of 86, she has completed over 40 IRONMAN races, each comprising of a 2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike and 26.2-mile run. For that, she is appropriately referred to as the “Iron Nun.”

Things of course haven’t always been easy along the way, as during her journey Sister Buder has missed a race finish by a matter of seconds, suffered multiple broken bones, and been subject to numerous wetsuit issues. “The only failure is not to try, because your effort in itself is a success,” she exclaims, however.
