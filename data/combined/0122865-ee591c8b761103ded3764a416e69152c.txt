LAS VEGAS -- Former Henderson police officer Joseph Lawrance agreed to a plea deal Monday morning that required him to plead guilty to two charges in a DUI case.

Lawrance, 31, pleaded guilty to disobeying a police officer and DUI. Lawrance was arrested on Oct. 23 on U.S. 95. According to police, there was whiskey, prescription pills and a loaded gun in his vehicle when he was stopped.

Lawrance was released on house arrest and will have to wear an alcohol monitor and participate in a year-long alcohol treatment program. He will be sentenced on the two charges in December.

Henderson Police told 8 News NOW that he was terminated Monday.
