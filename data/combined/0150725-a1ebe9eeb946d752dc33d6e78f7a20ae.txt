Hello everyone!



Officially, my convention season has come to an end! I had a blast at all the conventions I went to!

So I am having a sale on all my extra posters, postcards, and buttons!

The following is my current inventory available!







[This space will be updated with which items are sold out!]

Buttons are $2 each

Postcards 4X6 are $2 each

and 11x17 posters are $8 each

Shipping is a flat $5 for buttons and postcards

Due to size and need of a poster tube, any 11x17 ordered there will be an extra $4 added.

But if you spend $30 or more, shipping will be FREE!

Please contact me via johan@johansrobot.com with your order or any questions; I will reply with confirmation on order as well as a paypal address to send the payment.

If you have any questions either ask me via email above, comments here on DA, or note me here on DA.

Take care,
