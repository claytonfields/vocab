​Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino has supposedly made an offer to Club Atletico Independiente to sign their young striker, Ezequiel Barco.





The 18-year-old is hot property over in Argentina, and has been courting the attention of some of Europe's biggest clubs.

As reported by ​Don Balon though, Tottenham are the first club to put a significant offer in for the striker - doing so a couple of weeks ago.





They haven't yet received an answer though, and the player has apparently asked his representatives to put his services forth to Real Madrid and Barcelona, but neither of the Spanish giants want to sign him this summer.





The news is likely to go down well with Spurs fans, who have yet to see their club do anything with regards to signing players this summer, whilst some of their rivals around them have.

Barco is expected to earn his first call up to the Argentine senior side for their crucial World Cup qualifier with Uruguay next month.





Pochettino may feel as though he is well placed to secure a move for Barco, given they are compatriots and the 45-year-old's understand of Argentinian football - he started his playing career with Newell's Old Boys.
