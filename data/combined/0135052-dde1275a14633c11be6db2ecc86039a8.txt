Electronic Entertainment Design and Research, an independent firm, has compiled data in a new report that suggests Sony's PlayStation Network "Welcome Back" program was successful in not only increasing consumer awareness and the sale of digital titles but also presented a new sequel strategy.

Using data from three sources, IGN GamerMetrics, GameTrailers, and Google Insights, EEDAR determined the program, which included free downloads for Infamous, LittleBigPlanet, Dead Nation and WipEout, "caused an increase in awareness and acquisition of titles where a newer iteration was available (i.e. LittleBigPlanet 2). In one case, it increased the awareness and possible purchase intent of sequels even though a sequel was non-existent (i.e. Dead Nation 2)."

EEDAR says that LittleBigPlanet 2 "experienced a 66% gain in IGN Page Views and a 23% increase in Unique Interest (an IGN viewer indicating interest or purchase in a title) in June compared to the month of May," suggesting consumers played LittleBigPlanet for free through PSN and looked for more information on the sequel and potentially bought it.

On GameTrailers.com video views for the LittleBigPlanet 2 trailer increased 69% over the comparable time period, the report states.

And through Google Insights, consumer searches for "Dead Nation 2" "skyrocketed" the week of June 11th. "Similar to LittleBigPlanet 2, EEDAR believes this data suggests consumers were actively seeking for more information (and possibly would have made a purchase, if a sequel had existed) for Dead Nation 2."

All in all, EEDAR offers two interesting recommendations for publishers:

1. Release a free version of an older iteration of a game before the launch of its next iteration for a limited time.

2. Release an older iteration two to four months after a new iteration has been launched for a limited time, suggesting the free offering "would likely boost sales of the new iteration while the new iteration still maintains its premium pricing structure ($59.99/$49.99) and has appropriate shelf space."
