On Friday, actor Leonardo DiCaprio will join anti-beef Hindu group Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) at the group’s 50th anniversary celebration in the United Kingdom. DiCaprio—along with Virgin Airlines owner Sir Richard Branson and English broadcaster Sir David Attenborough—has chosen to attend the event in hopes of using his star power to raise awareness of RSS’ proposed beef ban. While the motivation for the beef ban for the Hindu group is religious, DiCaprio joined the movement to connect beef consumption with environmental and ethical issues. The actor—who is rumored to be vegan—previously lent his fame to shed light on the horrors of animal poaching, arranged a vegan menu and dessert bar at this year’s official Oscar after-party, and executive produced vegan documentary Cowspiracy.
