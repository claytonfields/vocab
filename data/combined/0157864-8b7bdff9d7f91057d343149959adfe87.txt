Males are much more likely to go overboard than females



Carnival passengers (33 incidents) are more likely to go overboard than passengers from other cruise lines...especially passengers on the Carnival Conquest



The average age of a passenger who goes overboard is 41 years



You are most likely to fall overboard on the last night of your cruise



For some reason, people from California and Florida go overboard more than others



Falling overboard does not necessarily mean you will die (16 people have been rescued, one after 18 hours in the water)



Most people who fall overboard are either drunk or doing silly things (climbing on the railing or between cabin balconies) VACATION & CRUISE SPECIALS Check out these great deals from CruisePage.com
