A Beeton farmer is questioning whether he can stay in business after last week’s flood devastated his crop fields.

Barry Dorsey, 59, of Dorsey Farms in Beeton, has definitely seen better days.

“We’re not doing good, we just can’t keep up with the water, it just keeps coming,” he said.

The rainfall began Thursday night (June 22) and continued until Friday (June 23) at noon, leaving about 20 acres under water.

Things got much worse around 2:30 p.m.

“It happened within a half an hour,” he said. “I don't know if they opened dams, or whatever, it just devastated us. Bailey Creek flooded and it was just like a tsunami coming down the field.”

Dorsey, whose been farming potatoes, carrots and onions for 45 years, said the second deluge left crops underwater.

Dozens of fish from nearby streams were also left stranded in the fields.

“We’ve had more rain before and I’ve never seen those fields look like that,” he said.

The irrigation pumps have been running non-stop, but he’s already lost an estimated $2-million worth of crops.
