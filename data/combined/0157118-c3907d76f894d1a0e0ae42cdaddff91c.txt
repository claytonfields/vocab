Titan Comics Continues Partnership with Games Workshop with ‘Blood Bowl’

Titan Comics are continuing their partnership with Games Workshop with a brand new series based on Games Workshop’s Blood Bowl board game and video games.

Blood Bowl: More Guts, More Glory will be written by Nick Kyme with art by Jack Jadson.

If you aren’t familiar with Blood Bowl it was originally released in 1986 as a board game, but more recently was relaunched in November 2016. The universe is an alternate version of Warhammer where domination and inter-species rivalries aren’t settled on the battlefield, but on the football pitch.

Blood Bowl: More Guts, More Glory will detail the story of a rag-tag team of humans, the Hochland Harbingers, as they try to claw their way to the top of Blood Bowl League. A former star player who crashed to rock bottom, Dreng Sturmblud, will try and lead the Harbingers back to glory and fend off their terrifying opposition foes.

Blood Bowl: More Guts, More Glory #1 will feature four different covers from Tazio Bettin & Luis Guerrero, Connor Magill, David Sondered, and Ørjan Svendsen. There will also be a video game cover.
