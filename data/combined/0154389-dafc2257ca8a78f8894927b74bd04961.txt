“Anywhere he goes just try to bomb the place, shoot up the place, do something”

Shock video shows an anti-Trump Mexican urging other Mexicans to “Kill Donald Trump and as many of his supporters as possible.”

The video was uploaded to YouTube but was subsequently made private. The version above was captured by a pro-Trump Facebook page.

In the clip, the young man openly calls for the assassination of the Republican presidential candidate.

“We, Mexicans, have to kill Donald J. Trump before he becomes President. He is a threat to every single one of us. There are many Mexican Americans living in the U.S. right now and I’m asking them to kill Donald Trump before he becomes President. The ones in Mexico who have the means, I’m asking you to cross the border and go and kill Donald Trump, and as many of his supporters as possible,” he states.

Anywhere he goes just try to bomb the place, shoot up the place, do something. If you could go back in time and kill Hitler, and kill the Nazis, would you do it? We have a modern day Hitler, and we have to kill him before he gets into power,” he adds.

“So I want you to spread this message, and I’m encouraging every single Mexican out there who has the guts to stand up for the Mexican people and to kill Trump and his Nazi followers. Let’s do this. Viva Mexico! F**k those motherf***ers,” he concludes.

The reference to Hitler underscores the fact that the media’s total demonization of Trump is encouraging lunatics to think that assassinating him is a noble cause.

Back in June, 20-year-old Michael Sandford grabbed a police officer’s gun during a Trump rally in Las Vegas as part of a plot to kill the Republican nominee. Trump has been wearing a bullet proof vest for almost a year due to the sheer number of death threats he receives on a daily basis.

As I document in the video below, the characterization of Trump as a would-be dictator by the media and the excuses made for those who physically target him as a legitimate form of protest is emboldening actual extremists to plot violence.
