2010 ZSHC Winner

After much anticipation and a rather thorough debate, we have reached the deadline. We are happy to announce this years 2010 Zombie Safe House Competition Winner of the Gold Shovel Award!

SS Huckleberry

Gold Shovel Award

(letter from the designer)

As a designer I would like to contextualize the gravity of this design and its contribution to the world of architecture.

Actually not at all.

I love zombies. I love design. It was just a matter of time really.

While I have spent many many hours daydreaming of the zombie apocalypse, I have never sat down and put pen to paper to create a plan. I have also wanted to take a trip up the Mississippi for some time now as well, so this project granted me the opportunity to explore the potential of all these things I love.

We are all so surprised by the amazing interest shown from around the world and would like to thank all of you who took part in the voting. Please check back as we plan to start a new round of competition within the next month or so….and of course begin your sketches for the 2011 Zombie Safe House Competition….I have a feeling it will be much larger than this year. Next year’s competition due date will be 1 week before Halloween, so we are looking to have a registration date of September 15th, 2011…mark your calendar.

Again, thank you for your interest. We received votes from all around the world showing that zombies are part of the universal language.
