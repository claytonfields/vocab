It looks like there will be a lot of ground to cover at the BCAC November meeting. The proposal is to discuss:

Scope, direction, and goals of the Active Transportation Master Plan

Input, direction, and feedback for the Active Transportation Master Plan

Consideration of “signature projects”

Any potential barriers to achieving a connected network
