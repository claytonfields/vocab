Democratic gubernatorial candidate Heather R. Mizeur received some national exposure on the MSNBC network Wednesday -- thanks in part to the South American nation of Uruguay.

The MSNBC cable television network interviewed Mizeur after a segment on Uruguay's move this week to legalize and regulate the distribution -- not just the personal use -- of marijuana. Mizeur, a state delegate from Montgomery County who is seeking the Democratic nomination of governor, has proposed a similar law in Maryland.

Such as proposal is also under discussion in New York, MSNBC reported.

Introduced by host Chris Jansing as a "dark horse" candidate, Mizeur argued that "prohibition has not worked" and that "our marijuana laws have been enforced with racial bias." As has has in Maryland, Mizeur contended that the money raised by taxing marijuana could be used to finance an expansion of pre-kindergarten education.

Mizeur is facing Lt. Gov. Anthony G. Brown and Attorney General Douglas F. Gansler, statewide officials with greater name recognition, in the June 24 primary.

Jansing gave Mizeur an opportunity to lay out much of her campaign platform for the liberal-leaning MSNBC audience.

"People are excited about my candidacy for governor of Maryland because I am an unapologetic progressive," she said.

Mizeur also laid out her plans to move beyond a widely supported increase of the minimum wage to $10.10 to adoption of a "living wage" of $16.70 by 2022.

"No family should have to work 40 hours a week and still live in poverty," she said.

Mizeur, 41, also talked about her selection of the Rev. Delman Coates of Prince George's County as her running mate, saying the combination of an openly gay woman and an African-American minister might strike some as a "very odd pairing." But she said the two share a passion for civil rights and shaking up the system.

"We're going to Annapolis to end politics as usual," Mizeur said.
