Torn and stained screens in shabby old cinemas aren't helping the film industry's quest to win Australians back from movie piracy.

At first glance you might assume that all cinemas are created equal, but if you have an eye for detail then you'll appreciate how widely the quality can vary even within the same cinema complex. Having taken my family to Hoyts Highpoint in Melbourne's north west twice these school holidays, I've vowed not to go back until it does something about its decrepit older cinema theatres.

We only go to the movies a few times a year, so it's frustrating to spend your money only to discover that the picture would have looked better at home. While the cinema chains like to brag about the quality of their new cinemas, they're clearly happy to let their old cinemas fall into disrepair.

First my family saw The Lego Batman Movie in Cinema 9, which has a large stain on the right-hand side of the screen which is clearly visible during bright scenes. The movie has been out in the US for months, I was determined to wait until it reached Australian cinemas – to set a good example for my children – but you shouldn't need to take a squeegee on a stick to the movies just to ensure the screen is actually clean.
