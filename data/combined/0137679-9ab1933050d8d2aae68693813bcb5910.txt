Barcelona Masia graduate focused on Milan future

Vitolo and Deulofeu on Barcelona watch list

In recent months, Gerard Deulofeu has reignited his career, after it appeared he had reached his peak and stagnated at Everton.

A winger of unquestionable talent, he has found the consistency he has desired for so long since joining AC Milan, and he opened up on what it was like having to leave Barcelona's famed La Masia academy.

"The Lionel Messi comparisons hurt my development," he stated. "It generated too much expectation surrounding me amongst Barcelona supporters - there is only one Messi.

"I don't normally read the newspapers but this comparison really stuck out."

One of his heroes however, was a bit earlier than the Argentine, and is a player that changed the club in equal measures.

"Ronaldinho has always been an idol of mine," Deulofeu continued. "He is who I admired when I was at Barcelona."

As to whether he'll one day return to the Blaugrana, anything can happen but the La Roja winger is focusing on the present.

"My dream is right now, the present," he concluded. "I want to enjoy the moment I'm in with Milan."
