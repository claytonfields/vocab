With that said there are rules that have to be followed and if you break those rules you have to be dealt with but I am not going to judge these young men on failing a drug test. I am sure the last thing any college kid wants to do is take a drug test. Hopefully it is a learning lesson for these kids but they don't need so called fans judging their lives or their decisions. They made their choices now they must live with the consequences and it isn't fair to have those fans who know nothing about them berate them because they can't help their favorite team win. If it is your first instinct to name call and tell everyone how stupid they are then you damn sure better have a clean closet....
