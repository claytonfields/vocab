Talking to St Helens Star, Barba said he was excited to be making his debut for the club.

"It's a game I'm really looking for to, I can't wait,” Barba said.

"You hear the boys talk about it and guys that have experienced the local derby and it's a good way to announce myself on the scene.”

Barba started playing rugby league for Norths Devils in Mackay before signing with Canterbury Bulldogs in 2007.

The 28-year-old won the Dally M medal in 2012 and joined the Cronulla Sharks last year to go on and win the NRL premiership.
