The five men were ordered to pay 24,000 euros, or about $27,000, in compensation to the victim, The Associated Press reported.

The Helsingin Sanomat, a leading Finnish newspaper, said that the victim, whom it did not name, had screamed and resisted after she was cornered in a hotel room by several of the volleyball players, then raped. It reported that some of the men had held her hands and pulled her hair, and that one of the men had laughed at her. It also reported that she had been filmed, and that the assault had lasted 90 minutes.

The victim told the court that since the attack, she had trouble sleeping and had anxiety and nightmares, the newspaper said.

The volleyball team competed in the Rio Olympics without the arrested players and lost all of its five games.

After the accusations emerged in July, the Cuban Volleyball Association castigated the athletes’ behavior, saying that it was counter to the “discipline the sense of honor and respect that govern our sport and society.”
