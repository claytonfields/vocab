We’ve got sad news to report to Avicii fans. It appears that the Swedish superstar producer and DJ will be cancelling all future shows, including his headlining performance at this year’s TomorrowWorld, due to health reasons. While the extent to which Avicii’s health is affected remains unclear, it appears that even his recent surgery during this year’s WMC and the resting time that followed was not sufficient for recovery from his ongoing health problems.

During this year’s Winter Music Conference, Avicii was urged to undergo an emergency surgery because of problems with his gall bladder, causing him to cancel his Ultra Music Festival performance, resulting in deadmau5’s substitution. It was later revealed that Avicii also had his appendix removed during that time. Following the surgery, Avicii took some time off to rest and recover from the strain of his surgeries. From the statement below, it does appear that Tim did not fully recuperate and needs more time to regain his health.

Here is the official statement:

At Night Management has tabled all touring and promotional activities for Avicii, aka Tim Bergling, until further notice so that he can fully recuperate from lingering health issues related to surgeries that removed his gall bladder and appendix earlier this year. The international superstar, who is the #1 Most Influential Artist Under 25 according to Spotify, is taking a break at home in Stockholm so he can regain his strength and physical well-being before the release of a new album project next year.

The news is all the more saddening considering that today happens to be Avicii’s 25th birthday. On behalf of the entire Your EDM team, I wish Avicii a speedy recovery so that he may further pursue his passion and rejoin fans at events around the world.
