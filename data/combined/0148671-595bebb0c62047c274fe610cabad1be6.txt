Tottenham new boy DeAndre Yedlin has been granted a Governing Body Endorsement – meaning he doesn’t need a Latvian passport to play for the club after all, reports Tom Hopkinson in the Sunday People.

The USA right-back, whose grandmother hails from Baltic state, had applied for the documentation that would allow him to work in the European Union amid fears that a UK work permit would not be granted.

But his concerns have been allayed after the UK Border Agency rubber-stamped the necessary paperwork and he is now set to complete his move to White Hart Lane early next month.

Yedlin has spent the past couple of weeks on holiday after helping Seattle Sounders reach the MLS play-offs. They lost in the Western Conference final - the semi-final of the MLS Cup - to eventual MLS Cup winners LA Galaxy.

The 21-year-old was a star performer for the USA at the World Cup in Brazil and his displays prompted Spurs to push through a £2.75million deal.

According to the criteria given to all clubs in the football pyramid, a player who is not from the United Kingdom or a British overseas territory, a British crown dependency or a member of the European Economic Area, must obtain a Governing Body Endorsement under Tier 2 of the United Kingdom’s five-tier immigration scheme.
