Gaming host Geoff Keighley has clarified the controversy surrounding No Man's Sky $60 price point, stating that the decision to sell the title at such a margin was not the decision of Sony, but rather that of developer Hello Games.



Speaking about the game during the inaugural episode of his Live with YouTube Gaming show, found below at the 1:47:48 mark, Keighley mentioned having discussions with spokesperson Sean Murray with regards to the charge, going so far as to state that he had "disagreed" with them.



“I disagreed with them charging $60 and putting it in a box. I think what they should’ve done was put it out as an Early Access game and let people play it and build over time with the team and the community."





The man later added "We all wanted to believe in No Man’s Sky and Sean did, too, so much so that he was never able to build up the gumption to rip off that Band-Aid and reveal what was and wasn’t in the game."



Sony’s heavy involvement in the release of No Man’s Sky led many to falsely believe that the company was serving as its publisher, when in actuality Hello Games handled the responsibility and Sony dealt with its distribution. As a result, many concluded that Sony had decided that the game should be priced as a full retail release.



Keighley went on to divulge even more about his opinion on the game, stating that he thinks it's “unfinished” and “repetitive."
