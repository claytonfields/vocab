Manchester United’s stars were left angry at the obvious booing of Marouane Fellaini on Sunday.

The Belgian is thought to have been consoled in the Old Trafford dressing room after thousands of supporters were heard jeering his introduction as a late substitute during the 1-0 win over Tottenham.

Dissenting voices could be heard as Fellaini warmed up along the touchline minutes before in a direct response to his kamikaze cameo at Everton the week prior.

Phil Jones revealed the United squad were not happy with his treatment. The defender sighed and said: ‘It is disappointing but he is a strong boy. He is mentally strong to cope with that don't worry.

‘We know what he is good at and he has to carry on. That's what he is there to do. He does a good job for us. He has to put it aside.’

Jose Mourinho dedicated United’s first home Premier League win since September to the central midfielder - but did maintain fans have a right to vocalise their displeasure.

After the match, Phil Jones said the booing by the United faithful was 'disappointing'

The Portuguese offered Fellaini a show of faith by bringing him on just days after his mistake at Goodison Park cost United three points.

‘In the last match, it was him that was involved in the loss of two points, and that's why I want to make it clear he is an important player for me,’ Mourinho said.

‘The fans can do what they want and they have been phenomenal with us. I just have to thank them for everything they are giving us, especially in the period where we are not giving them too much so I am really happy with them.

‘They can also be big critics, and the point was that they have in their mind the mistake that Marouane did at Everton. He is a player that I like. He will always have my protection.
