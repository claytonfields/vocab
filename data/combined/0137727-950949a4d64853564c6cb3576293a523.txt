All you want is a comfortable night’s sleep without congestion, irritation or pain, right? And you want to be warm and comfy all night long without getting hot and sweaty. An innovative aloe vera comforter could be the solution you need for a great night’s sleep that will allow you to wake up feeling better than you thought possible.

Think that infusing a comforter with aloe vera can’t possibly make any difference since it won’t even be touching your skin most of the time anyway? I was skeptical, but I’m sleeping well and I really like this comforter, so what more do you need to know?

I’ll offer up a few more details and you can decide for yourself what you think about getting an aloe vera comforter of your own.

My Aloe Vera Comforter Review

I like the affordable and completely comfortable Nature Relax – Premium Aloe Vera White Down Comforter that I got from Amazon. This cover is made from 100 percent Egyptian cotton that’s infused with cooling, soothing aloe vera extract. What you end up with is a great comforter that’s good for keeping you warm and good for keeping your allergies at bay.

The 10-inch baffle box construction is responsible for keeping the down inside from shifting around, and that’s important. Some comforters get cold spots when holes come in the filler inside, causing some of your body not to be completely covered at it should be.

So what about the aloe vera? Does it make any difference?

Some people are so sold on aloe in bedding that there are aloe vera mattresses on the market — and other kinds of aloe vera bedding too. Aloe has been used for centuries for cuts, burns, stomach upset and more because it’s proven to speed up healing. And it also reduces irritation. Some traditions suggest it has a calming and soothing effect as well.

Nature Relax talks about how the company infuses aloe into the Egyptian cotton with nanotechnology to make bedding products like this comforter. I don’t understand that and don’t suppose I need to know what that means. All I know is that I like the way the comforter looks and feels. It does seem to feel silkier than regular comforters.

And if it matters to you, this product is made in America. It’s clearly well-made and has stood up to several months of use on my bed already without showing any signs of wear. That’s what matters most.

Some Final Thoughts On Aloe Vera Comforters

Here’s the bottom line: I’m obviously sold on the effectiveness of aloe vera. I can’t tell you for sure that its presence in bedding makes a significant difference, but I can tell you that this comforter looks and feels great. It’s warm without being hot and it’s soft without feeling like it’s been soaked down with juice or gel.

Nothing is more important to me than a good night’s sleep, and I now sleep on an aloe vera mattress with an aloe vera comforter. You may think I’m overdoing it, but I’m more comfortable than ever. (The sheets are just regular sheets, by the way.)

So why not give this comforter a try? The price is reasonable for what you get, and I like everything about it.
