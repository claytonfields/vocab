Big Brother's Ryan Ruckledge and Hughie Maughan have revealed they were actually together before this year's show.

But according to Ryan, he "wasn't aloud" to reveal their secret connection.

In September the guys announced they were engaged, two months following this summer's Big Brother UK where we all assumed they had first met.

At the time, the couple took to Twitter to announce the news.

"So the cats out the bag me and @hughie_maughan are officially engaged! So happy and can't wait for the future #biggaygypsywedding ??" Ryan tweeted.

Hughie added: "FINALLY me and ryan can announce that we are officially ENGAGED! We are so happy and everythin feels right, huge hi five 2 the doubters"

Their fellow BBUK housemates were quick with their congratulations, as Ryan invited Georgina Leigh Cantwell and Lateysha Grace to be bridesmaids.

Now preparing to celebrate Christmas together, Ryan revealed on Twitter that he and Hughie actually met last year before entering Big Brother.

"It's actually not our first Christmas together we met last year before big brother, but first official Christmas, wasn't aloud to say before," Ryan tweeted.

However he claimed that show bosses didn't know of their connection, which included previously dating.

"No they didn't know we knew each other but me and Hughie have dated in the past well before big brother and then ended up in there together," Ryan explained online.

The former X Factor contestant added: "Yeah we knew each other VERY well if ya get me haha, but must of looked like we never , we dated for a few months a year ago X"

Big Brother is back next year on Channel 5.
