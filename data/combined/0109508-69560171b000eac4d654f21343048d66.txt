A young MBA pass out has decided not to accept his degree at the first convocation of Islamic University of Science and Technology (IUST) in Kashmir from Union HRD Minister Smriti Irani as a protest against "diminishing freedoms" in the country.

"Though, for a student, receiving a master's degree is no less than any prestigious award. But on October 19, (the Convocation Day) I Sameer Gojwari won't accept it," Gojwari, who completed his MBA from the IUST in 2008, wrote on his Facebook page.

Gojwari's post came in response to unconfirmed reports that Irani will be giving out degrees to the pass outs of the IUST at the varsity's first ever convocation on Monday.

"When India's writers are returning literary awards to protest diminishing freedoms and 41 writers across the country have given back most prestigious awards; unofficial reports say that Islamic University of Science & Technology on its 1st Convocation have chaired a Minister from Central Ministry #BJP, most likely Mrs Smriti Irani," he said.

The Union HRD minister is scheduled to lay the foundation stone of Central University Kashmir complex at Ganderbal on Tuesday.
