The Queer Geeks Of Texas Find A Haven At HavenCon

Texas is known for a lot of things, both good and bad. But whatever your thoughts may be on the lone star state, it's clear that the Queer Geeks love HavenCon based in Austin.

Established in 2014 with it's first show in April of 2015, HavenCon has had over 1000 attendees (2015 boasted 1200 with this year's show seeing roughly 1400) through it's deliciously queer doors.

Is it the celebrity guests? Is it the video games? Or how about the cosplay? It could be all of the above, but it's clear that "Love, Community, and an Inclusive space" are the driving forces behind HavenCon's success.

Brain child of Shane Brown, a life long geek himself, HavenCon has seen geeks of every shape and size come through it's doors.

Cosplaying Drag Queens? Check.

Gender Bent Cosplay? Double Check.

Furries? Got Em!

LGBT Artists and Creators? Absolutely.

With panels ranging from "Coming Out In The Gaming Industry" to "Pups 101", HavenCon has offered a space for everyone to express themselves in the most open and friendly way possible. (Source: https://havencon2016.sched.org/)

HavenCon is currently fundraising to secure upgraded space for 2017 tentatively scheduled for April 28th - 30th. So far they've achieved a whopping 80% of their goal in just 1 week and the geeks are abuzz with the theme for next year titled "That's So Retro" - Showcasing the geekdoms from the 70s, 80s and 90s.

While planning and preparations are underway, HavenCon will need to reach that magic 100% to move forward. So head on over to their Indiegogo and check out the fun retro themed perks for those wishing to attend or if you just want to support an awesome, geeky, inclusive event.
