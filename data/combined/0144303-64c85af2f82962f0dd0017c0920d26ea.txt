Fox’s apparent restraint dates back at least to December, immediately following the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Media observers noticed that the channel was the last to start covering the Dec. 21 media event by the National Rifle Association’s chief executive, Wayne LaPierre, and the first to move on to another story. It cut away while Mr. LaPierre was still speaking, an unusual step for a cable news channel.

Since then, Fox reporters have covered gun safety proposals and Fox commentators have reliably defended Second Amendment rights. Several hosts, including Sean Hannity, have criticized President Obama’s alliance with the families of some Sandy Hook victims; Mr. Hannity at one point called the families “props for his agenda.”

Debra DeShong Reed, a spokeswoman for the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, said Fox’s calls to her group had been rare and, on those occasions, adversarial.

“The requests always come from a position of, ‘Hey, we found a study that says you’re completely wrong! Want to talk about it?’ Or they want us to come on with a guest from the opposite fringe of the other side.”

MSNBC hosts at almost every hour of the day have repeatedly argued for tighter gun restrictions in the four months since Sandy Hook, suggesting that the subject is a way to rally progressives — or at least progressive-minded cable TV viewers.

Fox’s distance from the subject is all the more notable because Rupert Murdoch, the chief executive of the channel’s parent, News Corporation, has pressed for stricter gun control. After the shooting at Sandy Hook, Mr. Murdoch wrote on Twitter, “When will politicians find courage to ban automatic weapons?”

But Mr. Murdoch’s views are not always reflected on Fox. The chief executive of Fox News, Roger Ailes, has almost complete autonomy. Mr. Ailes reportedly has a license to carry a concealed handgun in New York City, where Fox News is based.
