About Me

I've been a Dungeons & Dragons Dungeon Master (DM) and player since the mid 90's.

I currently run two D&D 3.5e campaigns, one with heroes and the other with a group of villains.



I post resources that can be used to add a little something more to your game. It could be sharing tips or suggestions, answers to questions I'm comfortable with, inspiring images, encounter ideas, or anything helpful or fun I find online that relates to tabletop gaming.

Most of what I post will be meant to apply to D&D 3.5e, but a lot of it will be system-neutral.



Thanks for visiting!



A Note on Tags:

I use tags to remind myself of what an image/tip/tool/etc could be USED FOR not what it's from. I sometimes add a tag reflecting the source if I'm certain of it, but frankly that's not what I care about. So yes, I am fully aware that the subject of a post may ACTUALLY be from X,Y, or Z and NOT D&D (for example).

Thank you, tumblr tag police. ;)
