For The Capital's three-part series, education reporter Cindy Huang examined teacher experience levels across 12 public high schools provided by a 2016 database of school employees, their salaries, years of experience and obtained through a public information request. Also examined was data of classroom teachers, including department chairs to determine how many teachers at each high school began the year with three years or less of experience. The school system provided the turnover rates for teachers. The data includes all employees in the Unit I employee union, which is represented by the Teachers Association of Anne Arundel County.

Among those interviewed over four months; teachers and former teachers at once designated "challenge schools"; Superintendent George Arlotto; Speaker of the Maryland House Michael E. Busch; parents, students and union leaders; and national education researchers.
