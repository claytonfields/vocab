Santa Paws, you have seriously spoiled my furbabies! You went all out and you didn't have to at all. Your love and generosity know no bounds! It's been a really rough week for me and sharing these gifts with my family has made it so much better.

A list of the fantastic gifts from our Santa Paws:

KONG Cozie Marvin the Moose Dog Toy KONG DoDo Birds Squeaky Dog Toy Milk-Bone MaroSnacks 40-OZ Activitoys The Wave Bird Toy Polly's Cuttlebone Bird Perch (Banana and Orange flavor calcium) Hanging Snuggle Cave Hut Kaytee Chin Chilla Granite Cooling Stone KONG Kickeroo (Tiger) Catnip Toy KONG Kickeroo Stix Giraffe Toy SmartyKat Scrunchy Bunch Cat Toys

Our kitties wanted their catnip toy so badly that they managed to break into the closet where we hid them until such time as I could get a picture of everything together :)

Effie, our 'keet, is already playing up a storm with her Wave toy and Fluttershy our chinnybutt is trying out her hanging cuddle hammock (which she will probably then chew to death by morning.) The puppies adore the Milk-Bones, which the video shows, and also won't go anywhere without the DoDo KONG squeaky toy.

We're so happy :D THANK YOU THANK YOU!
