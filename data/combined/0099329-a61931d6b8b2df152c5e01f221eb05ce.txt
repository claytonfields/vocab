Billionaire business mogul Mark Cuban recently was with “Extra’s” Renee Bargh on the set of his hit ABC show “Shark Tank,” where he is never afraid to share his honest opinions when contestants pitch their ideas to him.

When Renee asked Cuban about his former friend, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, he held nothing back. He said, “You know what? It’s rare that you see someone get stupider before your eyes, but he’s really working at it…You have to give him credit. It’s a difficult thing to do, but he’s accomplished it.”

Cuban, who has accomplished a lot as owner of the Dallas Mavericks and as an investor in many other businesses, questioned Trump’s decisions, pointing out, “Let’s look at it this way: Name one good deal he’s done… When he talks about his great renegotiations, they’re renegotiations, so tell me if you think this is a good deal: I lose four casinos, they go out of business, but I’m really good at renegotiating the debt of his companies that have already gone out of business.”

Mark smiled, “He’d get kicked out of 'Shark Tank' so fast, it would make your head spin.”

Cuban also made it clear he used to be friends with Trump, but revealed they haven’t spoken in the last month. “He sent me an email when I started picking on him… What happened was I really didn’t like Ted Cruz, so I started helping Donald, tried to encourage him, 'cause I thought he’d be, and to this day thought he’d be a better candidate than Ted Cruz… But at some point, you’ve got to start learning and understanding the issues, you know? Donald has been at this a year but you don’t look at him and say, ‘Wow, he’s gotten so much smarter on this topic or that topic.' In fact, you look at him and say, ‘What the hell are you talking about?' That’s not good for America.”
