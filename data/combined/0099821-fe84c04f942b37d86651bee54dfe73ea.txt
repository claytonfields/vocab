He would have gotten away with it, too, if it hadn't been for that elastic waistband.

Tazviona Maluge Bhebe, 40, entered a London liquor store last January, wielding a kitchen knife and disguised with a pair of light blue boxer shorts over his face, according to the Telegraph. Police say the Zimbabwean man then threatened to "use the knife" if store employee Harry Mahalingham, 34, did not give him money.

Mahalingham, however, was not about to give in to demands from a talking pair of underwear. The sales assistant leapt over the counter, grabbed a display sign, and proceeded to beat Bhebe with it, the New Zimbabwe reported.



Ultimately, Bhebe's disguise failed him. Security camera footage shows the boxer shorts slipping off the robber's head, revealing his face. Police identified Bhebe based this footage as well as DNA samples from the underwear, which the would-be thief discarded as he fled the shop, according to UPI.
