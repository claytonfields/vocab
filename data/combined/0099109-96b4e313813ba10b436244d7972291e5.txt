BACK UP YOUR SAVE!

So, this is basically my favorite game on the vita!I made this save editor today.(It's in C#, I have never used that before, I'll put the source up on github later when it is cleaner and updated a bit more, don't worry.)Windows only, never thought I would do this, sorry!I want to add inventory/storage editing.I can already do simple stuff, like changing amounts, good for the dlc exp boosts(I will see if I can inject the dlc exp boosts to the save without needing to buy them)We can do cool stuff like having 255 scapedolls (I guess more, it's 16bit), instead of the normal max of 5.When I set scapedolls to FFFF, it didn't get used upon death, so that wasn't good.But stuff like monomates, if you set to FFFF, you can still use them (and the value won't even go down to FFFE)If anyone can have a look at items, how they are stored in the save, please shareI think items are stored in 16 bytes, but I might be wrong.I assumed monomates, dimates, trimates would be together in memory, but no they are spread out... strange.I can edit stuff like gran arts/technique levels, but I will add this stuff to the editor later.Any bugs etc, please tell me.Enjoy
