Homeownership rates tumbled this summer statewide and across much of Southern California.

The U.S. Census Bureau reports 53.5 percent of Californians lived in a home they owned in the third quarter, down from 53.8 percent in the second quarter and up from 53.2 percent a year ago. It’s the fourth-lowest level nationwide behind Washington, D.C., New York and Hawaii. West Virginia was best at 75.6 percent.

Ownership in Los Angeles and Orange counties fell to 46.6 percent in the summer quarter, second worst among 75 markets tracked trailing only Fresno. L.A.-O.C. had the nation’s lowest ownership levels in six out of eight quarters in 2015-16. Third-quarter ownership in L.A.-O.C. was down from 48.3 percent in the second quarter and 44.7 percent a year ago.

In San Diego County, ownership was 54.1 percent in the third quarter, eighth worst vs. 56.1 percent in the second quarter and 54.4 percent a year ago.

Gains were only found in Riverside and San Bernardino counties where ownership hit 59.2 percent in the quarter, 19th worst out of the big 75. Inland Empire ownership is up from 58.4 percent in the second quarter but down from 62.6 percent a year ago.

Other government stats show Southern Californians spending the biggest share of their household pay among major U.S. metro areas. That’s a key reason why Southern California’s renter households grew by roughly 749,000 in the past 10 years — a 33 percent jump. Meanwhile, the number of local homeowners was essentially flat.

Nationally, 63.9 percent of Americans lived in homes they owned in the third quarter, up from 63.7 percent in the second quarter and 63.5 percent a year ago. It’s also the highest homeownership rate since 2014’s fourth quarter.

By the way, best metro area for ownership? Allentown, Pa., at 75 percent in the third quarter.
