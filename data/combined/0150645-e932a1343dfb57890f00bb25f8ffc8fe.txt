Kevin Jones from Clevelandbrowns.com joins us for our Cleveland Browns season preview. Of course we talk Johnny Manziel but we also discuss players who are actually starting for this team including:

-How does Terrelle Pryor fit into this offense?

-Is Danny Shelton the key to a big improvement in the rushing defense?

-and what exactly is wrong with Justin Gilbert? Will he even be dressed for week 1?

Plus, weâ€™ll recap week 1 on the college football season. Our focus was on which player would start at QB for Ohio State, we forgot that the former starter is a pretty good athlete. And, will Christian Hackenberg survive the season behind that awful Penn State o-line?
