The Who won't be kicking off the second leg of its 2015 The Who at 50! tour Sept. 14 at San Diego's Valley View Casino Center.

That show, along with three subsequent opening dates on the autumn and winter leg of the legendary English band's tour, was postponed Tuesday morning. The reason, according to a statement issued by The Who's U.S. press representative is "to allow lead singer Roger Daltrey proper time to recover from an unspecified virus he contracted."

The other three postponed shows are Sept. 16 at Honda Center in Anaheim, Sept. 19 at Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas and Sept. 21 at Staples Center in Los Angeles. The four postponed concerts wil be rescheduled, possibly following the group's Dec. 13 show in Oakland, which was to have concluded its 2015 tour.

Tickets for the four postponed concerts will be valid at the make-up dates, or can be refunded at point of purchase. For more information, contact AXS at axs.com or (888) 929-7849.

It’s “the beginning of the long goodbye,” Daltrey said at a 2014 London press conference announcing this year's tour. “It will have a finality to it. We’ll stop touring, I’m sure, before we stop playing as a band... It’s the grind of the road, it’s incredibly tough on the body... I don’t know how many more years I’ll be able to sing this music.”

True to his word, The Who had to cancel three U.S. tour dates in May because of vocal problems that prevented Daltrey, 71, from performing.

The nature of his current virus (and when it developed) is unknown. But it may explain why even The Who's rhythm guitarist, Simon Townshend, and drummer, Zak Starkey, were not available for interviews to preview their Sept. 14 San Diego concert.
