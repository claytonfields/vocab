Man dragged by subway after his backpack got stuck

A 28-year-old man was injured after his backpack got caught on a subway in Manhattan Sunday morning and he was pinned between the train and the platform, police said.

The man was sitting on the floor of the 50th Street station with his back against a pillar as a 1 train pulled into the station around 5 a.m.

As the man stood up, his backpack became ensnared on the moving train, which pulled him about the length of three subway cars, cops said.

The manâ€™s legs were pinned between the train and the platform when police arrived, officials said.

The man was eventually freed and rushed to Bellevue Hospital in stable condition.

Police said the man is not believed to be homeless and was not intoxicated at the time of the incident.
