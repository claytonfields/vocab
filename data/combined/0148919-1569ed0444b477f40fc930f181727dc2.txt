people panic about Twilight with wings

Behold our mighty Alicorn ruler, Princess Twilight Sp... Oh, wait.Well, being an Earth Pony Princess is not so great. Alicorn seems to be much more fun.I'm really excited for the Season 3 finale. While, I present to you a vision of Princess Twilight without her horn.She has a bit of a 'princessy' look (long legs, long hair, etc.), but with several differences: instead of that fancy crown thingy, she has a diadem - she is depicted as one of the humble Earth Ponies after all. Also, I decided to replace her fancy boots with bracers and added a matching necklace. All of this presented in a weird foreshortening perspective. Ta-da!I've recently found my old colored pencil stash and instead of studying for my finals, I was drawing ponies, what is clearly much more important.I hope it's good enough to share (It's been so long since I've made traditional art, and it's always been rather lousy) and I also hope you'll like it.I would appreciate any feedback, and If you're a reddit user, you can also leave me an imaginary internet point there, I wouldn't be mad at all if you did._______________(Princess) Twilight Sparkle and My Little Pony belongs to (c) Hasbro.
