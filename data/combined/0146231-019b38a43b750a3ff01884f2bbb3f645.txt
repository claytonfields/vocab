Madden NFL 16 Tennessee Titans Team Breakdown

The Tennessee Titans will be a really fun team to play with in Madden 16. Drafting Marcus Mariota and Dorial Green-Beckham instantly made the Titans a lot better.

We have the full Madden 16 Titans team breakdown below.

Team: Tennessee Titans

Offensive Strategy: Marcus Mariota. It sounds weird to base your entire offense around one player but Marcus Mariota is that good in Madden 16. He has all of the passing attributes you will need as well as really good running ratings. Mix in a little Bishop Sankey and Dexter McCluster every now. This offense should be really fun to play with.

Defensive Strategy: Rush the passer. Derrick Morgan and Brian Orakpo form a really strong pass rush. If you can force the other quarterback to make rushed decisions, you should be able to force a few turnovers.

Impact Players: QB Marcus Mariota, HB Bishop Sankey, WR Kendall Wright, WR Justin Hunter, WR Dorial Green-Beckham, TE Delanie Walker, DT Jurrell Casey, LOLB Derrick Morgan, MLB Wesley Woodyard, ROLB Brian Orakpo, CB Jason McCourty

Key Newcomers: QB Marucs Mariota, WR Dorial Green-Beckham, TE Anthony Fasano, LOLB Brian Orakpo



Strengths: Defense. The Titans have a strong defense that should be able to slow down some of the better offenses in Madden 16.

Weaknesses: Running Back. The Titans don’t have a really dominant running back. Bishop Sankey and Dexter McCluster can both be really good at times but they can’t dominate the whole game. Luckily, it should be easier for the running backs to move the ball this year since other teams will have to be so worried about Mariota.

Overview: The Titans are improved from last year but they are still a team that won’t be able to compete at the very highest levels in online play. They will, however, be a very popular pick to start a franchise with.
