While hosting the 2015 Soul Train Awards on Sunday night, Badu made sure to throw a major diss the "Black Widow" singer's way. During her monologue, the singer made fake calls to people and pretended to invite them to the show. One of those people was Azalea.

"Uh, yes? Who is this? Iggy Azalea?" Badu said. "Yeah, hey. Oh, no, no, no, no, you can come, 'cause what you doin' is definitely not rap."

Ouch. That one's gotta sting a little.

The audience responded with thundering applause.

Azalea caused quite the stir back in May when she won the Billboard Music Award for Top Rap Artist, beating out Drake, Nicki Minaj and J.Cole, and the award for Top Rap Song (for "Fancy"). People were so disappointed, they actually started a petition to get the latter revoked. In 2014, Azalea beat out Eminem and Drake at the American Music Awards for Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Artist and Album, which people also weren't happy about. Judging by her comments, we'd say Badu is one of those people.

But Azalea isn't one to back down, so it's only a matter of time before she speaks out on this latest beef.
