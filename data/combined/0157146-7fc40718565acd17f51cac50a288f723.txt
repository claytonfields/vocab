Dodgers minor league outfielder Joc Pederson was named by Baseball America as the No. 35 prospect in baseball, as the publication released its top 50 midseason prospects on Tuesday. He was the only Dodgers prospect to show up in the top 50.

Pederson, 21, is hitting .299/.388/.522 with 14 home runs, 19 doubles, 60 runs scored and 38 RBI in 82 games for Double-A Chattanooga. He has also stolen 25 bases in 28 attempts.

The uncredited Baseball America blurb on Pederson noted, "Overshadowed by Yasiel Puigâ€™s breakout year, but Pederson too can hit, hit for power, field and run."

Pederson last played on July 3 but has been sidelined with a strained oblique, per Dylan Hernandez of the LA Times. Pederson has only missed three games, thanks to a series of weekend rainouts in Chattanooga.

Pederson was not in the preseason top 100 prospects at Baseball America, but he was listed by the publication as the No. 4 prospect in the Dodgers' system. Hyun-jin Ryu was No. 42 and Puig was No. 47 before the season and both have made substantial impact on the Dodgers this season.

The preseason No. 3 prospect was Class-A Great Lakes shortstop Corey Seager, 19, who did not show up on Baseball America's top 50, but was ranked No. 35 two weeks ago by Baseball Prospectus in their midseason prospect rankings. Julio Urias, 16, was ranked No. 41 by Baseball Prospectus but did not show up on Baseball America's top 50.
