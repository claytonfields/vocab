A trip to the local beauty salon for hair highlights has landed an eastern Pennsylvania woman in jail after she couldn't pay the bill.

According to our sister website, LehighValleyLive.com, Tia Dawn Hassler, 46, of Bethlehem Township, Northampton County, was charged with theft, arrested and jailed earlier this week when she couldn't pay for her $100 hair highlights at the Intrigued Salon.

Salon staff told investigators they informed Hassler how much the highlighting service would cost prior to the treatment, and there was no indication she couldn't pay, the news website writes.

But after her hair was properly highlighted, Hassler allegedly told the hard-working hairdresser she had no money.

That's when the salon dialed 911 and made the alleged hair highlight heist a police matter.

Hassler was arraigned Sunday with bail at $5,000. But as of Tuesday, she remained in Northampton County Prison, unable to post bail.
