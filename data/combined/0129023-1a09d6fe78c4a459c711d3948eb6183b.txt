“It’s no secret I’m a big fan of Mike Pence’s,” said Paul D. Ryan, the speaker of the House from Wisconsin. “We’re very good friends. I have very high regard for him. I hope that he picks a good movement conservative. Clearly, Mike is one of those.”

The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, said picking Mr. Pence would be a “good move by Donald Trump.” Mr. McConnell, who has sharply rebuked Mr. Trump in recent weeks for his indiscipline on the campaign trail, said he would “look forward to enthusiastically supporting the ticket.”

To Democrats, Mr. Pence cuts an unimposing profile, and party officials said Thursday they considered him unlikely to transform Mr. Trump’s deeply unpopular public image. On the contrary, his archconservative social views could help motivate liberal voters and young people to turn out for Hillary Clinton in the fall.

At the same time, Democrats have looked with some dismay at Mr. Trump’s tenacity in the Midwest, and at his unusual popularity with white men. Mr. Pence could reinforce Mr. Trump’s strengths in both areas.

The Senate minority leader Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, indicated that the focus of the fall campaign would be Mr. Trump himself.

“It’s not going to help him that much, no matter who he picks,” Mr. Reid said.

For Mr. Trump, selecting Mr. Pence would be a sharp departure from habit, and the surest sign yet that he intends to submit to at least some standard political pressures in the general election.

Mr. Pence’s public audition for the No. 2 spot, when he appeared with Mr. Trump on Tuesday at a rally in Westfield, Ind., went well. Standing ramrod straight, Mr. Pence offered five and a half minutes of high-energy remarks, frequently turning his fire to Hillary Clinton in an apparent attempt to demonstrate that he could be an attack dog against her.
