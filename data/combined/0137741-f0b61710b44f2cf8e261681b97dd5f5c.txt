‘Power Rangers’ Ends Theatrical Run With $140.2 Million Worldwide



Despite there being a considerable number of fans who were excited about a new Power Rangers film, that enthusiasm did not translate into the box office success that Lionsgate probably hoped would lead to a new film franchise. Box Office Mojo reports that Power Rangers will end its theatrical run with a worldwide gross of $140,246,402.

With a disappointing $85,364,450 domestic gross, fans had been hoping the overseas intake would help the film improve on its box office numbers.

While the disappointing box office results for the film may have dashed any hopes for a sequel, a second film may still be possible due to high sales of Power Rangers toys.
