Erik "Tabzz" van Helvert has announced in Twitter his departure from Origen. The dutch player has been playing as the marksman of Enrique "xPeke" Cedeño's team during the 2017 spring split. This news comes just a week after Origen's relegation to the Challenger Series. Tabzz is the second player of the roster that has officially announced his departure from the team — the first was Max "Satorius" Günther.

Being only 23 years old, Tabzz is one of the most experienced professional League of Legends players, starting his career in 2011. He has played in several high level teams like Lemondogs, where he disputed his first World Championship in 2013, or Alliance, team with he would play in the 2014 Worlds and that would rebrand to Elements.

After the dismantling of Elements, that sold its spot to Schalke 04, 2016 was probably one of his most turbulent years. He signed for Banditos, a team that he would leave to compete again in the LCS with Team ROCCAT. However, for the summer split he would go back to the Challenger Series with Millenium.

He started 2017 with Origen, where he would end up sharing the botlane with two different supports: Aleksi “Hiiva” Kaikkonen — who would be replaced in the sixth week of the split —, and the owner of the club himself, Enrique "xPeke" Cedeño.

According to David "Carving" Primo, co-founder of Origen, Tabzz would be one of the most hard working players of the team. However, the internal problems of the organization would end up unmotivating him and reverberate on his performance.

After this unfortunate season, that he started with high expectations, the dutch marksman ends his relation with Origen and is looking for opportunities from any league, but he specifies that would prefer playing in the North American or European LCS or Challenger Series.

Regarding Origen, the club has yet to make a public statement.
