The Tampa Bay Buccaneers have the dubious distinction of being the only team besides the Jaguars to receive no Super Bowl odds. Once again, the boys in Vegas are right on in their assessment, as there's a better chance of Toronto mayor Rob Ford being reelected than Bucs coach Greg Schiano raising the Lombardi Trophy.

Tampa Bay actually acquitted itself extremely well against the Seattle Seahawks, opening up a 21-0 first-half lead. Alas, the upset wasn't meant to be, as the team eventually lost 27-24 in overtime. It's worth noting that the team played extremely hard for Schiano. It would have been an easy spot for the team to lay down, but it instead showed grit and determination.

Rookie quarterback Mike Glennon has actually been pretty solid, despite losing all five of his starts. He's thrown eight touchdown passes against only three interceptions and seems due for his first victory, which could very well come this Monday night, when the Bucs host the only franchise in more turmoil than they are: the Dolphins.

Despite the team playing hard and Glennon's improvement, though, the bottom line is that the Bucs are 0-8. With all the talent strewn throughout their 53-man roster, that's totally unacceptable.

Don't expect Schiano and his staff to be back in 2014.
