Ingredients

100 milliliters (ml) tonic water

30 ml gin

1 tablespoon lemon juice

Sugar

Show your support for House Stark with this cocktail idea from the Gruzka blog. It's a take on a gin and tonic with some added flourishes to make it worthy of the North. Put 100 ml (about 3.3 ounces) of tonic in the freezer and wait until it's frozen. Put some sugar on a shallow dish and coat the rim of a martini glass with some of the lemon juice. Dip the glass into the sugar and let dry. Crush the tonic into slush and add it to the martini glass and finish with gin and a tablespoon of lemon juice.
