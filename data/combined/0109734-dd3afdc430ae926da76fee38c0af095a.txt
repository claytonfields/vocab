The new South Park RPG, The Fractured But Whole, is not coming to the Nintendo Switch, despite a tweet this week that suggested it might be.

"South Park: The Fractured But Whole won't be coming to [the Nintendo] Switch," a representative for the South Park studio told IGN. Ubisoft, which is developing game, declined to comment when approached by IGN.

Earlier this week, the official South Park Twitter account tweeted about Nintendo, kicking off rumors that The Fractured But Whole might be coming to the system. The tweet might have instead been a reference a Season 10 storyline regarding the Nintendo Wii.

In February, Ubisoft confirmed the latest delay for The Fractured But Whole. Previously set to come out in Q1 2017 (January-March, 2017), it is now slated to arrive sometime during Ubisoft's fiscal 2017-2018, which translates to April 2017-March 2018.

The game was originally set to come out in December 2016, but in September of that year, Ubisoft announced the delay to 2017 to "make sure the game experience meets the high expectations of fans."

The Fractured But Whole is coming to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. It is being developed internally at Ubisoft San Francisco. 2013's South Park: The Stick of Truth was made by Fallout: New Vegas studio Obsidian Entertainment.
