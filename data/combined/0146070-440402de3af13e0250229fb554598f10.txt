Letter from Silent Heaven was created for the sole purpose of showing my love and gratitude for Silent Hill 2. Never before have I appreciated a game so much and have it open up my eyes to a whole new standard for interactive art as what Silent Hill 2 has done. Silent Hill 2's fear factor is set on manipulating your own mind. For what you hear is not always there. What you see may not be what you really saw. For the fear and horror used in Silent Hill 2 resonates with a player on a more primitive level: It pits your own imagination against you. Your mind will create much of the fear that unfolds throughout the game. It is the game's masterful use of restraint and balance that creates a sinister form of terror that has made Silent Hill 2 the timeless horror masterpiece it is today.
