E! News has reached out to Mirra's rep for comment.

City of Greenville mayor, Allen Thomas, also released a statement: "We mourn the loss today of a great friend and wonderful human being who touched the lives of so many around the world with his gift. He called Greenville, North Carolina home and was as humble a guy talking with kids on a street corner about bikes as he was in his element on the world stage. A young life with so much to offer was taken too soon."

The release from the police department continues to state that they will be handling the death investigation, and that the family of Dave Mirra would appreciate privacy during this very difficult time.

Mirra is survived by his wife and two children.

"Holding nearly every accolade possible for a BMX or action sports athlete, Mirra has won everything from 'Freestyler of The Year' by BMX Magazine to the ESPN Action Sports and Music Award for BMX Rider of the Year in 2000," his website states.

"After a brief stint hosting the popular MTV series Real World/Road Rules Challenge, Mirra and his wife settled down in Greenville, N.C., quickly making it the hub of the BMX world."

Aside from being a fixture in the world of BMX riding, Mirra was a proud husband and father. Posting various photographs with his two young children, the 41-year-old often tagged the snapshots #BeaDadNotaFad.

He also shared a quote about fatherhood on his Twitter photo that read:

"As a father, you are automatically inducted into the Hall of Responsibility. "Life is about ups and downs, great times and tough times. My responsibility as a father is to show my kids balance, education and character. Although I'm not perfect, I am always keeping my eyes open for a better way to be the best father I can be."

Our thoughts go out to his loved ones during this tragic time.
