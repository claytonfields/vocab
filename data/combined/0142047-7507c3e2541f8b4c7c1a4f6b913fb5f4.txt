Giorgetto Giugiaro ( Italian pronunciation: [dʒorˈdʒetto dʒuˈdʒaːro]; born 7 August 1938) is an Italian automobile designer. He has worked on supercars and popular everyday vehicles. He was born in Garessio, Cuneo, Piedmont.

Giugiaro was named Car Designer of the Century in 1999 and inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 2002.[1]

In addition to cars, Giugiaro designed camera bodies for Nikon, computer prototypes for Apple, Navigation promenade of Porto Santo Stefano, and developed a new pasta shape "Marille",[2] as well as office furniture for Okamura Corporation.[3]

Influence on design [ edit ]

Giugiaro's earliest cars, like the Alfa Romeo 105/115 Series Coupés, often featured tastefully arched and curving shapes, such as the De Tomaso Mangusta, Iso Grifo, and Maserati Ghibli. However, as the 1970s approached, Giugiaro's designs became increasingly angular, culminating in the "folded paper" era of the 1970s. Straight-lined designs such as the BMW M1, Lotus Esprit S1, and Maserati Bora followed before a softer approach returned in the Maserati Merak, Lamborghini Calà, Maserati Spyder, and Ferrari GG50.

Giugiaro is widely known for the DeLorean DMC-12, featured prominently in the Hollywood blockbuster series Back to the Future. His most commercially successful design was the Volkswagen Golf Mk1.

In 1976, Giugiaro explored a new taxi concept with the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA), which became the 1978 Lancia Megagamma concept. Fiat had commissioned the 1978 concept from Italdesign, asking for a 4-meter, high roof, high h-point, multifunctional, monospace design — but ultimately found the concept too risky for production. In retrospect the Megagamma was more influential than it was itself successful, becoming the "conceptual birth mother of the MPV/minivan movement"[4] — giving rise to such mini/compact MPV's as the Nissan Prairie (1981) and Fiat 500L (2011) as well as larger MPV's including the Renault Espace and Chrysler minivans.
