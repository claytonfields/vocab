Jay Z and Kanye West are two of the biggest musicians in the world, so it's no surprise that they have elaborate tour riders for when they hit the road. But, are they THAT crazy? According to the riders—unearthed by TMZ—Jay and Kanye each like to have their pre-concert rooms set up in a very specific ways.

Jay reportedly demands that the room temperature be precisely at 71 degrees, while Kanye insists that the hotel find a speaker system that was discontinued 10 years ago. Jay also makes sure that his room is completely childproof when Blue Ivy is with him, which means all the outlets are covered and her organic whole milk is stocked.

Compared to some of the crazier tour riders over the years, Jay and Kanye's seem to be pretty run of the mill. For instance, Mariah Carey made sure that she had 20 white kittens and 100 doves in her room before a show in London a few years back. Iggy Pop is another wild one, as he requests that a Bob Hope impersonator be at every one of his shows. Hov and 'Ye might just be pretty ordinary when it comes to the tour riders.
