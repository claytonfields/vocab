You know how sometimes you’ll be watching FOX News and Shep Smith takes over the entire prime time line-up because of a big breaking news story?

MSNBC did that on Thursday night. They interrupted the Rachel Maddow show with the breaking Syria story reported by Brian Williams. Maddow fans saw this as a form of sexism.

The Washington Free Beacon reported:

Rachel Maddow Fans Accuse MSNBC of Sexism for Bumping Her for Brian Williams

Rachel Maddow fans on social media were outraged when the MSNBC host was bumped Thursday night in favor of MSNBC breaking news anchor Brian Williams.

Williams is typically brought on for any breaking news event, and he covered the late-night U.S. cruise missile strikes against a Syrian government airfield. Fox News and CNN also preempted their usual primetime programming in order to have their breaking news anchors–Shepard Smith and Anderson Cooper, respectively–cover the events live.

Check out these tweets from Maddow fans:

so brian crashes into rachels show – and when 11 hits – he takes over and she disappears – no goodbye – WTF MSNBC? – so sexist – so rude — ROSIE (@Rosie) April 7, 2017

.@MSNBC why did you bring in Brian Williams to cover breaking news during @maddow air time? Rachel is more than competent. #EverydaySexism — Amy Volz (@wescott_amy) April 7, 2017

Hey @MSNBC why did u call Brian Williams in on @maddow when news hit? She is MORE than capable, didn't need backup Disappointing. #Syria — Terryl (@terrylb89) April 7, 2017

Even @MSNBC thinks Brian Williams, with his sketchiness, is more competent that a woman to handle breaking news-put Maddow on now, please. — Girls Really Rule. (@girlsreallyrule) April 7, 2017

So MSNBC bumps Maddow for Brian Williams. #Sexist — Stephen (@NewJerzeyBoy) April 7, 2017
