Thanasi and his wife Sophia were shopping today and while in the check out line, chit-chatting amongst themselves in the language of their parents and grandparents— Greek, they were verbally accosted by a woman who didn’t like the fact they were speaking a foreign language.

They are both American-born and are raising their kids to speak Greek, as well as the obvious English. And like many Greek Americans, speak Greek amongst themselves to not only practice the language but also to keep it viable in their families.

“Speak fucking English, this is America” the woman behind them said as they spoke amongst themselves and minded their own business.

Thanasi captured the end of the exchange on video and posted to his Facebook, just as the manager of the store came to ask the women to leave.

“We don’t allow that kind of abuse of our customers,” she told the couple as she threw the woman out.

Thanasi added about his experience:

“Sophia and I were in line at the market, and naturally, speaking Greek. Out of nowhere this lady behind us decides to give us a modern history lesson and tells us, “Speak F*@king English, this is America.”

“Furthermore, she demonstrated her well-versed use of the English language by using every swear word to describe us and how we don’t belong here.”
