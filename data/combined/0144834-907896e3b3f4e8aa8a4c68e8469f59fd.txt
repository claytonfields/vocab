This morning, Duke announced seven new inductees into its Athletics Hall of Fame for 2016. Included in that group are two former basketball legends: Grant Hill and Shane Battier.

Duke basketball’s Instagram account congratulated Hill and Battier with personalized posts.

Both guys are more than deserving of this honor. Frankly, we’re surprised it took this long for Hill to be chosen.

He’ll join former teammates Christian Laettner (class of 2007) and Bobby Hurley (class of 2011) as inductees. Battier’s teammate Jay Williams was called into the Hall in 2013.
