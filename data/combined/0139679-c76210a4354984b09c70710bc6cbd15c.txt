Massive Chalice, a tactical strategy game from Double Fine, will leave Steam Early Access and launch as a full title on June 1, according to an announcement on the game's Steam page.

The Xbox One version of the game is "appearing around then too." The game's 1.0 version on Steam adds controller support, achievements and the same UI navigation the Xbox One version will have.

"After many months of designing, building, reading through our early access feedback and playing the game for hours on end, we're finally in lockdown," the announcement reads. "That means the team is in the final stages now; working purely on bug fixing, performance and polishing things up, in between sending builds off to Microsoft for certification."

Massive Chalice was funded via Kickstarter in 2013. For more on the game, check out our hands-on preview. Massive Chalice is currently available on Steam for Linux, Mac and Windows PC.
