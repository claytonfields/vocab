When Belgian illustrator Raphael Vicenzi was coming up with an artitsic pseudonym, he returned to a childhood photo for inspiration. "It originates from this picture of me sitting on a pony when I was a very young child. I was making a face because I was so terribly scared of this huge white beast.I realized that the pony was most certainly dead and that one day I would be gone as well, hence the name.That kinda put everything in perspective at that time; Life, death, what's going on in between and after." With that, Mydeadpony was born.

Mydeadpony had been a work in progress over the course of many decades. As a child he was always doing "something creative [but] I was never encouraged by my family to pursue an artistic career. I [think] it's all a matter of opportunities that come your way at a certain point in your life."

Illustration and graphic design may be staples of his work now, but when Vicenzi found himself in an office during in his late twenties, these art mediums seemed intimidating. "I didn't know anything about graphic design or illustration. Web design quickly became too complicated for me."
