Thank you SO much /u/cooningthedog. This gift was an awesome surprise! My secret santa shipped super early (seriously, the same day they pulled my info they sent me a message!). Today it finally came in. When I first opened it, I was a little confused. I first saw a USB 802.11 wireless adapter. I thought to myself 'cool! I can use this on my G4 iMac, it still doesn't have an airport card'. But there were still two other boxes. One of them was wrapped up with a letter. I opened the unwrapped one and I was pretty confused. It was a USB power adapter. So, then I opened the wrapped present. The note said "Hey! I'm cooningthedog (you can call me Tim). I thought that would really enjoy a Raspberry Pi because you like programming. Hope you enjoy it and that you have a wonderful holiday! Cheers!". At that point I was almost freaking out, cause I've always wanted a Pi.

Thanks so much Tim. You rock, and have a great holiday!!
