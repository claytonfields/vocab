'TRON: The Next Day - Flynn Lives Revealed' Video Leaked Online

"Flynn came backâ€¦ just a little bit younger." Get it while it's hot! We were tipped by @CoreyMPAnderson that the full 10-minute secret "epilogue" to Tron Legacy that's supposed to be on the upcoming DVDs, out in about a month, was uploaded in high def on YouTube. The video is titled TRON: The Next Day - Flynn Lives Revealed and is sort of a viral continuation past the events that occurred in Tron Legacy, which also links into the Flynn Lives viral and the events that occurred in our world as well (so awesome). It's long and goes over a lot of history in the middle, but at the end everything is revealed - with spoilers. Check it out!

Watch the video below (with spoilers) and chat about the special appearance at the end in the comments.

Tron Legacy was released in theaters on December 17th late last year after two years in production and has gone on to make over $395 million worldwide. Did you enjoy the movie? Comment on the Sound Off article.

Tron Legacy was directed by first-time filmmaker Joseph Kosinski. The screenplay was co-written by Adam Horowitz ("Lost"), Richard Jefferies (Blood Tide, Living Hell), Edward Kitsis ("Lost") and the director of the original movie, Steven Lisberger. This was first greenlit because the test teaser played so well at Comic-Con. Disney finally opened Tron Legacy in theaters on December 17th last year in IMAX 3D, the truly optimal viewing experience. The movie will arrive on DVD & Blu-Ray starting April 5th - I've got mine pre-ordered.
