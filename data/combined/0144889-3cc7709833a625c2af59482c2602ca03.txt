Ted Cruz isn’t a free-market libertarian, Ron Paul warned his son’s former supporters on Friday.

“You take a guy like Cruz, people are liking the Cruz — they think he’s for the free market, and [in reality] he’s owned by Goldman Sachs,” he said of the Texas senator on Fox Business’ Varney & Company. “I mean, he and Hillary have more in common than we would have with Cruz and Trump or any of them so I just don’t think there is much picking.”

“It’s hard to find anybody — since Rand is out of it — anybody that would take a libertarian position, hardcore libertarian position on privacy, on the war issue and on economic policy.”

Paul also warned that Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders wasn’t much better during a Mises Institute conference on Jan. 30.

“[Socialists] will not listen to the argument that there’s a difference between somebody getting bailed out by the Federal Reserve… versus somebody who produces a good product and we [the People] vote them their money [because] they haven’t cheated, stolen or given us a bad product,” he said. “I think it’s sort of an envy and resentment and I’ve talked to them but I have to tell you, I haven’t converted many die-hard progressives.”

“Some progressives, if you watch them on the Internet, will have really close agreements and might be talk about the same issues, but boy they don’t want you to even introduce the notion that libertarians are with them on this because they’re terrified we might encroach on their power to redistribute wealth [by force].”
