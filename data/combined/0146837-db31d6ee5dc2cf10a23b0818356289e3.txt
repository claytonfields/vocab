BOSTON – For the second year in a row, Celtics point guard Rajon Rondo surprised 100 youth with Christmas gifts for the holiday.

Partnering with the Yawkey Boys and Girls Club, Rondo arrived to the site Monday morning in a 20 foot UHAUL filled with bikes, electric scooters and iPads. The invited youth had no idea the party they were attending at the club was actually a holiday event with Rondo. Cheers and shrieks were heard as the youth saw their favorite point guard get out of the driver seat of the truck. The cheers got even louder as he opened the back of the truck to show the gifts!

“Ever since last year, I’ve looked forward to hosting this event again,” said Rondo. “I had a lot of people who helped me growing up and it’s important to give back to the community. Seeing how happy and appreciative the kids were to receive a gift today is all that matters and I hope they have a Merry Christmas!”

As each kid received a gift, they said ‘thank you’ before quickly running back into the club to show their parents!

“I’ve wanted an iPod for a long time,” one youth said. “I can’t thank Rondo enough for getting me one!”

Once everyone had a gift, they all went to the gym where Rondo watched the youth play basketball. After, Rondo joined the youth in playing his favorite game, Connect-4. At the same event last year, a young girl beat the All-Star point guard so he was sure to remain undefeated this time around!

Crowds surrounded Rondo as he played upwards of four Connect-4 games at a time, winning everyone of them.

“It’s one of my favorite games,” said Rondo in reference to Connect-4. “I played it all the time growing up and keep the tradition going at community events with youth!”

As the event came to a close, the group took a photo so they could always remember the day Rondo came to visit and provided them with holiday cheer!
