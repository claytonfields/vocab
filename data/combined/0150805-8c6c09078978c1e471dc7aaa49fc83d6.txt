Andy Burnham has hinted he could run for Labour leader for a third time - just two months after ruling it out.

In an apparent U-turn, the twice-defeated candidate told the Liverpool Echo "you don't know what the future brings".

But in August, before he lost to Jeremy Corbyn, Mr Burnham told PoliticsHome that he "definitely won't be standing again".

Back me and I'll win the election, says Andy Burnham

The Shadow Home Secretary came fourth when he first stood to be leader in 2010, a contest won by Ed Miliband.

He was the early frontrunner to win the top job when Mr Miliband quit after Labour's general election defeat.

But he was eventually beaten into a distant second place by Jeremy Corbyn.

Speaking to PoliticsHome before his defeat, Mr Burnham said: "If my moment is to happen, it will be now. If I don't win this time I definitely won't be standing again."

However, he has now left the door open for yet another tilt at the leadership once Mr Corbyn departs.

He said: "I have the feeling that if it was to be my time it would have been this one. But you don’t know what the future brings.

“I’ve always said I will always serve the party in any way I can but I don’t expect to [run again]."

Critics have blamed Mr Burnham's reputation for shifting his position on major issues as the main reason he lost out to Mr Corbyn.
