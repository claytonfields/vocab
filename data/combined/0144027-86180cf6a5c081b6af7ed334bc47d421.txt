A living room in green theme with touches of white and earthy tones on the accessories is apparently welcoming, what if the feeling is elevated by a piece in contrasting color?

The red silicone pendant lamp does just that by complementing the space with its color, design and appeal. Easy to install, the lamp stands out for its semi-transparent design creating an aura of glass owing to its resemblance. When turned on, the light is neither opulent nor understating, it is simply pretty like an inverted wine glass casting around some shimmer.

To bring out a different effect from this light a white Edison halogen bulb would be the best choice although the regular ones or the LED bulbs work quite well. While choosing the right spot for this bulb, we might end up with the center for conventional reasons. However corners and sides are good if you want to experiment or be different.

The red colored modern silicone pendant lamp in glass style is a contemporary piece in tune with the prevailing trends, but also good to blend into vintage themes as well. Hang it up in your living room, drawing room, bedroom or vintage themed study and turn on the magic!
