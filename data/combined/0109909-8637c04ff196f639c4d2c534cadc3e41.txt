A robber in eastern New Orleans shot a victim with empty pockets Tuesday morning (Oct. 13) after the man said he had nothing of value to hand over. The unidentified 63-year-old victim is in critical condition at a local hospital, according to Officer Garry Flot, spokesman for the NOPD.

The would-be holdup occurred just before 5 a.m. near the intersection of Morrison Road and Read Boulevard. The man told officers the robber, who was in a gray truck, approached him, pulled out a gun and demanded his property, Flot said.

When the victim told the robber he had nothing to give, the robber shot him twice and fled. The man was taken to the hospital where he was in surgery as of 6:30 a.m. No other information was available.
