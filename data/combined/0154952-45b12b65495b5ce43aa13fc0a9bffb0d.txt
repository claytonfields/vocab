UPDATE TUESDAY JAN. 26: The time-adjusted Live+same day rating for Sunday are in, and The X-Files went up by a full rating point from the partial 5.1 fast national result, to a big 6.1 in adults 18-49 and 16.2 million viewers from 10:24 – 11:24 PM ET. It held a respectable portion of its demo lead-in from the NFC Championship game (15.7), which drew a total of 45.7 million viewers.

PREVIOUS MONDAY: With Fox no longer reporting fast nationals, we won’t have time zone-adjusted numbers for the premiere of The X-Files following the NFC Championship Game until tomorrow (see ratings for the game here.). The partial data available is encouraging — the 10:30-11 PM portion of the show drew a 5.1 in adults 18-49, according to the fast nationals that don’t reflect the live nature of the telecast, which aired from 10:24-11:24 PM on the East Coast but 7:24-8:24 PM in the West. With the highly rated six minutes from 10:24-10:30 PM not accounted for, the rating will likely hold or grow despite the lower-rated 11:24 PM portion. The 5.1 demo number and a 11.1 metered household rating from 10:15-11:15 PM indicates a strong opening for the limited series sequel to the 1990s supernatural drama.

Fox most recently launched Season 2 of The Following after the NFC Championship Game in 2014. It drew a series-high 4.4 in 18-49 with a similar start time, 10:19 PM. So far, there had been little halo effect for the shows Fox and CBS have aired behind the NFL championship games — The Following for instance dropped to a 2.0 demo rating for its next episode, though it aired eight days later. The X-Files continues its run with Episode 2 tonight.
