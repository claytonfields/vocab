Queensland police have been warned that members of the latest outlaw motorcycle gang to move onto the Gold Coast say they would rather kill police than be arrested and face the government's new laws.

An internal notice sent to Queensland police officers warns the Mongols are stockpiling automatic weapons including M16 and AK47 guns.

''A member of the Black Uhlans CMG [criminal motorcycle gang] was previously confirmed to have sought to obtain automatic firearms (M16 and AK47) on behalf of the Mongols and Finks CMG,'' the ''Officer Safety Bolo'' [Be on the Lookout] alert reads. It went on to say that the escalating violence was said to be a result of legislation which meant automatic custodial sentences of up to 15 years.

''The Mongols are said to believe killing a police officer to evade arrest is worth the risk to escape the lengthy custodial sentence,'' the alert said.
