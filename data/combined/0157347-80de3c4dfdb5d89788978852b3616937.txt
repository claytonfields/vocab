I've been quite addicted to Magic: The Gathering several years ago, in college. Eventually I moved on, not being able to handle the speed of new additions, and switched to various board games.

Recently, however, I slowly became picking up this wonderful game again, when a couple of my new friends appeared to be M:tG fans of their own.

I have no idea how my gifter figured out this part of my interests: I don't remember mentioning it anywhere. But here we go: a couple of weeks of waiting, and I hold the newest complete expansion set, "Dragon's Maze", in my hands!

It has a ton of cards, nine boosters, two beautiful deck boxes, and a d20 dice! Ok, count me buried in Magic cards for the next several evening. Also, I already anticipate the day of testing all these treasures :) Thank you, gifter!
