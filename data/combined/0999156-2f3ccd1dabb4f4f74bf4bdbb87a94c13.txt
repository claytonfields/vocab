Martin Sheen says he’s “disgusted” by President Trump in a new Democratic fundraising pitch.

The “West Wing” actor, who played fictional President Josiah Bartlet on the long-running NBC political drama, slams the GOP in a Wednesday email from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC).

“My time playing the president on ‘The West Wing’ taught me what Washington should be like,” Sheen says in the fundraising email paid for by the DCCC.

“And right now, with the Republicans in control, it’s far from what we, as Americans, deserve,” writes the 76-year-old actor, who appeared in an anti-Trump, get-out-the-vote ad in 2016.

Sheen says he’s “disgusted” not only by Trump, but also by “the Republicans kowtowing to their rich special interests instead of representing the American people.”

And, he’s “most disgusted by the Republican effort to gut health care and social programs for Americans in need.”

The email comes the day after Senate Republicans postponed a procedural vote on their bill to repeal and replace ObamaCare. The bill had seen shrinking support after a Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report found it could leave tens of millions without healthcare.

It’s not the first time Sheen has slammed Trump. During last year’s White House race, Sheen dubbed the real estate mogul an “empty-headed moron,” telling The Hollywood Reporter, “he has absolutely nothing to offer us.”

Sheen has also lent his name to DCCC fundraising efforts before. In a March pitch, he said people always ask him how President Bartlet would handle Trump.

“He would tell America to stand up for what’s right, and fight back with everything it’s got,” Sheen wrote.
