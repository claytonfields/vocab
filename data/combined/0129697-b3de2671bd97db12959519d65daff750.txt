Maybe some of you remember previous Afro-House and Afro-Tech episodes which were both a good opportunity to explore the African side of electronic music. We stay in the same vein today with a mood which can be classified as something like… Afro Deep House. Percussions, dubby effects and atmospheric ranges are the main elements which will transport you to faraway places where spirits will try to get in touch with you. And you’d better revise your ancestral African language as spirits don’t speak English…
