AMD roadmaps detail Raven Ridge APUs and Pinnacle Ridge CPUs

AMD roadmaps detail Raven Ridge APUs and Pinnacle Ridge CPUs, listing both with a release in 2018 on desktop platforms. Both of these new CPUs will come with "Zen" CPU cores, though at this time it expected that AMD are already fine tuning their Ryzen design for improved performance.

According to this Roadmap, Raven Ridge APUs will release first on mobile platforms on 2017, coming with 4 "Zen" CPU cores and in a BGA configuration, releasing on desktops later on the AM4 socket.

Pinnacle Ridge is AMD's Ryzen/Summit Ridge replacement, coming with up to eight Zen+/Zen2 cores and will use the same AM4 socket as Ryzen.

Raven Ridge APUs are detailed as having 4 Zen CPU cores and 11 Vega GPU cores, giving the APU a total of 704 GPU cores (Each CU has 64 stream processors). This is only 192 fewer GPU cores than AMD's RX 460, which will make for a powerful APU given Vega's architectural improvements over Polaris.

Raven Ridge will be a perfect solution for those that want an affordable gaming notebook, which will easily be able to play most modern titles with respectable framerates on mobile platforms.
