The city of Kobe in Hyogo Prefecture, Japan, announced last week (Mar. 31), that a 22-year-old firefighter who tried to cover up that he had overslept for work by lying to police and telling them he had been kidnapped would be receiving a one month pay cut as punishment for his actions.

According to the city of Kobe, on December 25 of last year at about 10 a.m., the firefighter rushed into a police box in Kobe’s Kita Ward and filed a false police report, reportedly saying “I was kidnapped by several men around the area of Sannomiya Station.and they drove me around in their car.”

Police began to investigate the firefighter’s claim, however, they were unable to find any material evidence that supported his story. Police have since filed charges on suspicion of having filed a false police report, which is a violation of the Minor Offenses Act.

Although the firefighter was supposed to go to work on the day he filed the police report, he told Kobe City officials investigating the incident that he had overslept that morning. City officials quoted him as saying “I overslept, so I thought being kidnapped could be an excuse for being late to work.”
