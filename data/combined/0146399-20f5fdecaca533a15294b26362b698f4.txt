An Irish betting market is so confident that Hillary Clinton will beat Donald Trump that it is already paying off bettors.

Irish bookmaking market Paddy Power said it would close its U.S. presidential election book. The market would be paying slightly more than $1 million altogether for people who bet on a Clinton victory.

"Trump gave it a hell of a shot going from a rank outsider to the Republican candidate, but the recent flood of revelations have halted his momentum and his chances now look as patchy as his tan," said firm representative Féilim Mac An Iomaire in a statement.

Comparatively, the betting site OddShark.com has Clinton as the likely winner of the presidential election, as do others like Bovada Sportsbook.

Paddy Power has a history of making payments before the final votes are counted. In 2012, it paid more than £400,000 to people who bet on Barack Obama beating Mitt Romney, cheekily saying, "Sorry Romney, you're not black or cool."

Paddy Power also predicted the Conservative Party's upset victory in the United Kingdom's 2015 general election.

But like many, Paddy Power bettors miscalculated the "Brexit" vote, as many people bet the U.K. would vote to stay in the European Union.
