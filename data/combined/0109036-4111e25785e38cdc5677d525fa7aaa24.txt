"When I first found CVsIntellectâ€™s website online, I was pleasantly surprised by the nicely outlined and user friendly outlook of the pages. Fortunately for me, in my professional life I have had the opportunity to apply for different positions all over the world and to modify my CV according to the requirements of the country.



CVsIntellect gave me that flexibility and fluidity I really needed, and made the application process pleasant, because it is so easy to modify and completely reinvent your professional CV. The outlines I have used range from classical and conservative to urban and modern and can really prove to be an edge when it comes down to divergent appearance and first impression.



Moreover, the support engineers are constantly reinventing the functions of the website and the feedback personnel is very friendly and open to ideas and comments."
