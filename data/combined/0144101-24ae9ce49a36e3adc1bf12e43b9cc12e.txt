Two to three inches of ash accumulated on streets in some parts of the city, and authorities imposed limits on trucks and motorcycles to help speed up traffic.

Eddy Sanchez, the head of Guatemala's seismological institute, warned another eruption could take place "in the coming days" at Pacaya, the most active volcano in Central America.

Sanchez said the volcano has accumulated a lot of energy over several years.

"Like a pressure cooker, it will release the pressure violently," he told reporters.
