Professional Korean StarCraft player Lee "INnoVation" Shin Hyung, currently signed to Korean team STX Soul under the Korean eSports Association (KeSPA), is expected to join Team Acer on September 1 when his current contract runs out, sources close to the situation tell GameSpot.



Team Acer has declined comment. KeSPA has not returned comment as of this posting (it is 4:30 AM in Korea), but I have requested comment on both Innovation's contract with STX in relation to Acer's signing, as well as the proposed financial problems of STX Soul.



Barring any unforeseen consequences from the announcement of the announcement by Acer, Innovation will continue to join the team when his STX Soul contract runs out.



Sources do not include Reddit, Fomos, or Acer's own teasers. My sources, for all my news/articles, come from informed individuals close to whatever situation is currently at hand, never second hand sources. If I were to take news from Reddit itself, I would cite so in the piece, and never claim that to be my 'source' as it's ridiculous. While Acer's teasers may have been pretty blatant, there was still some wiggle room for it to be another player, and also did not impact my story as a source.

I was writing this up as of last night (before all hell broke loose this morning). They did prompt me to get this out today (though KeSPA totally owned me).

I mean given all the info fed to us by Scarlett and the silhouette by Acer it was like 98% going to be Bogus. The only thing that was blocking me was imagining that arguably the best player in the world would be joining Acer o.O



wow. Guess this will mean we'll be seeing him more at foreign events. I wonder how he'll fare.

MrVideo Profile Joined June 2012 Ireland 132 Posts #19 Kinda worried what this will mean for his level of skill. I mean, to go from the intense KeSPA regime to a less stressful schedule and an arguably easier set of opponents has to have an effect. On the other hand, INno did say that he mostly practiced ladder, and even if he moved to Europe, playing on the KR ladder isn't impossible.

And i am a bit worried for Innovation wether he is able to maintain his level without a full teamhouse environment.



The big question is in which WCS region he will play. Acer is a EU team and MMA is playing on EU despite living in korea(i think?).



And, on a side note i think that Acer is the next Team that is really pissed about Slasher I don´t know what to think about that. It´s kind of cool but as i think about it i question how many foreign talents could have been payed with this.And i am a bit worried for Innovation wether he is able to maintain his level without a full teamhouse environment.The big question is in which WCS region he will play.
