NEW YORK: Consumer Reports and its team of expert evaluates test and analyse virtually every car sold in the United States every year. Out those cars, there are a select few that stand above the rest and join the vaunted group of vehicles known as Consumer Reports Top Picks. For 2015, Consumer Reports has selected 10 cars ranging from an environmentally friendly hybrid to a family minivan. Of the 10 cars selected, six come from Japanese manufacturers, three come from American firms and one hails from Germany. To become a Top Pick, a car must excel at the publication’s track tests, offer average or better reliability and perform effectively in government or industry crash tests.

Best Compact Car, Subaru Impreza Price as tested $21,345.

In a segment filled with big names and even bigger reputations, the Subaru Impreza manages to take the top spot on the list with a strong overall package. The publication was impressed by the Impreza’s great interior, quiet ride, strong handling, and value for money.

Best Midsized Sedan, Subaru Legacy Price as tested $24,837.

Like its Impreza sibling, the Legacy also bested some of the most popular cars in the business to become a Top Pick. Consumer Reports found the Subaru to offer a quiet and comfortable driving experience, along with the best ride quality in the segment.

Best Large Car, Chevrolet Impala V6 Price as tested, $39,110.

The Chevrolet Impala is proof that General Motors can still build a great family car, Consumer Reports automotive content specialist Mike Quincy told Business Insider.
