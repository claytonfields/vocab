A MAN who shocked Britain after trying to have sex with a post box has been found dead outside a Chinese restaurant.

Paul Bennett’s body was discovered behind the Shanghai Palace in Wigan, Manchester early Sunday but police are not treating the death as suspicious.

They believe the 45-year-old’s death may have been drug related.

Last month, Wigan Magistrates court heard how Bennett had been spotted rubbing himself against the post box with his trousers down, before raising his arms in a star position, shouting ‘wow’.

He pleaded guilty to two charges of indecent exposure as well as using threatening and abusive words and abusive behaviour.

Bennett received a 12-month community order with a compulsory alcohol treatment and supervision program.

He was also ordered to sign the sex offenders’ register and pay £260 in victim compensation and court costs.

Paying tribute, an acquaintance of Mr Bennett said: ‘He had his troubles but he wasn’t a bad lad’.
