A mother trapped in her car under a mountain of snow wrote goodbye letters to her children, fearing she would not survive Buffalo’s epic winter storm.

“It felt like I was underground, buried in a casket,” Karen Rossi told The Buffalo News of her 13-hour ordeal.

Rossi was driving home Tuesday at 3 a.m. from Mercy Hospital in South Buffalo, where she works as a pharmacy technician, when her car got stuck in a snowbank. A plow passed to her side, covering her car with more snow.

“Sitting in the car, it’s funny what you think about,” she said. “You get punchy. You realize the magnitude of the situation. You never think this is the way you’re going to pass away. I started to think about my life and my family and my daughters.”

Her 17-year-old daughter called her and begged her to keep the tailpipe clear so she wouldn’t die of carbon-monoxide poisoning.

When Rossi’s phone died, she found some paper in her purse and wrote letters to her two daughters.

Eventually, she managed to climb out her window and tunnel a small hole to the surface, through which she waved her red snow brush until a passing motorist spotted it and dug her out around 4 p.m.

And those farewell letters? “My kids don’t even want to see them,” she said.
