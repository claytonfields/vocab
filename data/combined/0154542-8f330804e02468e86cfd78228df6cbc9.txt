Chung said he chose to paint the scene because he was upset at the results of the 2016 election.

"I spent days just weeping," he told the station, adding that he was surprised at his own reaction because he is not a "political person."

Chung said he painted actor Chris Evans' face on the superhero and tried to make the work reminiscent of 1980s rock posters "where there's a woman in tattered clothes clinging to a strong male hero's leg."

The school said it protects the rights of students of faculty to create such work no matter their "political or religious bent."

Katie Pavlich said Friday morning that someone should send a "therapy dog" to Chung, noting the continuing "hypocrisy" of the left when it comes to tolerating opposing viewpoints.

"It is free speech ... but we have heard for years from the left that we need to be tolerant and loving and accepting of everybody," she said.
