MADISON, Wis. -- The Wisconsin football team has agreed to a home-and-home series with Washington State, the two schools announced on Wednesday. The Badgers and Cougars will meet in Madison during the 2022 season before Wisconsin makes the return trip to Pullman, Wash., during the 2023 campaign.



This series is rescheduled from an original agreement that had the Badgers and Cougars squaring off in Pullman in 2014 and in Madison in 2015.



Wisconsin owns a 2-0 record all time against Washington State, with both games being held in Madison. The Badgers most recently defeated WSU, 42-21, in the 2007 season opener and pulled out a 35-26 win over the Cougars in 1976.



The Badgers and the Pac-12 have been frequent dance partners in recent years. Over the last 20 seasons, Wisconsin has played 16 games against teams from the Pac-12, owning a record of 11-4-1 in those contests.
