Sana'a/ Bengaluru, March 26: After Indian priest Fr Tom Uzhunnalil, 56 was believed to be abducted by ISIS militants from Aden, Yemen on March 4, a report in Dailymail stated that many religious groups fear that ISIS militants may have crucified the Indian priest on Good Friday.

Though there is no confirmation on the same, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj on Saturday said: "Fr Tom Uzhunnallil - an Indian national from Kerala was abducted by a terror group in Yemen. We are making all efforts to secure his release."

Earlier this week, a group of nuns posted on social media that they believe that Fr Uzhunnalil is being subjected to torture and may be crucified on Good Friday. However, members belonging to Uzhunnalil's order in Bengaluru have denied reports that he was due to be crucified.

On March 4, a group of terrorists stormed the Missionaries of Charity old age home in Aden and sprayed bullets on residents killing four including an Indian nurse, Cecilia Minz. Officials in Yemen believe that Uzhunnalil was abducted by these militants.

Swaraj on Saturday said that the government is making all efforts to secure the release of Uzhunnalil from his captors in Yemen.

Yemen is a conflict zone and hence there is no Indian Embassy there making it even more difficult for Uzhunnalil's release.
