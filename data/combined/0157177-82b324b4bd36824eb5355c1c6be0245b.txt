Banega: 'I'm going to Inter'

By Football Italia staff

Sevilla's Ever Banega confirms that he will be an Inter player: 'We've done everything officially'.

Although the Nerazzurri's mobility on the market has been hindered by the negotiations over the club's sale, the Argentinian was insistently being touted for a transfer.

“In Sevilla I was very happy,” he told AS. “I enjoyed two spectacular years that allowed us to win the Europa League twice. We did well in the championship too.

“I found my former Coach from Valencia, Unai Emery, and he was able to bring out the best in me. Fortunately we parted ways in friendship.

“I knew I could do well with him. I chose to leave, it was a tough decision but opportunities have to be seized.

“Yes, I'm going to Inter. We already found a deal and we made everything official with the club, now it's just a matter of waiting. But my mind is on the national team.

“I exchanged messages with [Javier] Zanetti. He complimented me for choosing Inter, but we didn't speak about playing, we'll get on to that after the Copa America.”
