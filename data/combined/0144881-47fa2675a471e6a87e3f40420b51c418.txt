Update: Dark Horse has now confirmed that Hyrule Historia will come to North America, UK, Australia and parts of Europe.

A Dark Horse spokesperson confirmed to IGN that the book is "going to be a page for page adaptation of the Japanese version with some minor tweaks," noting that "we are even translating the smallest of hand-written notes on the concept designs, some stuff that was too small to be legible in the Japanese version." As a result, the English version will be bigger than the original Japanese book.

Original story follows:

Dark Horse Comics has announced plans to bring The Legend of Zelda Hyrule Historia to the United States. The book is set to arrive for $34.99 on January 16, 2013 as a 9” x 12” hardcover with 248 pages.

This marks the first time that Hyrule Historia, which came to Japan in late 2011, will be translated into English. In addition to concept art and the full history of the Zelda franchise, the book also includes Nintendo’s official Zelda timeline, as well as a Zelda comic from manga artist Akira Himekawa. The English version will also include an introduction by Zelda creator Shigeru Miyamoto.

Dark Horse hasn’t announced whether the book will be headed to the United States exclusively or if it will come to all Western territories, but we’ve reached out to confirm and will update with any information we receive. Until then, be sure to watch the Hyrule Historia in action on Cheap Cool Crazy:
