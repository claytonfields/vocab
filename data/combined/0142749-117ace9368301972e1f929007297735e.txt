A Carrie Fisher return? It is official. Carrie Fisher has said she is returning to the Star Wars franchise for the J.J. Abrams’ directed Star Wars: Episode VII. We already reported that Harrison Ford was in talks to return as Han Solo and Mark Hamill talked about how he would like to return as Luke Skywalker, but Fisher is the first person to confirm they are returning.

Princess Leia is coming back.

The confirmation came in an interview with the Palm Beach Illustrated. The reporter asked straight up if Carrie Fisher was coming back, and she said “Yes.” It makes me wonder if the other two guys have already signed on as well, but haven’t spilled the beans yet. Hamill is almost a lock, but Harrison Ford is the tricky one.

According to Hamill, Star Wars Episode VII is supposed to deal with the kids of these classic characters, so having them return as parents, mentors, and maybe tragic figures is important to launching this new direction for the series. The Carrie Fisher return is just the start.

On a side note, I really hope they offer roles to the “non-face” actors like Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca), Kenny Baker (R2D2) and Anthony Daniels (C2PO) as just a show of respect.
