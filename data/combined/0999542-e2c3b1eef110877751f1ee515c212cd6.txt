Legalisation of no-fault divorce leads to 350,000 couples splitting in a year since 2010 in world's most populous Catholic country

The number of Brazilians divorcing has reached a record high, according to the country's IBGE statistics agency.

It said on Monday that there were more than 350,000 divorces last year â€“ 46% more than in 2010 after Brazil's congress made it quicker and easier to divorce in the most populous Catholic nation on earth.

Before 2010, Brazilians had to be separated with a judge's approval for a year before they could seek a divorce. But after an amendment to the country's constitution in 2010, such a separation no longer became necessary. The agency said this had prompted the record number of divorces, which have been monitored in Brazil since 1984.

Currently, as long as there is agreement between the divorcees and there are no underage children or incapable persons involved, a divorce may be performed by a notary. Divorce only became legal in Brazil in 1977.
