Winnipeg's MTS Centre is getting a whole lot flashier with $12 million in enhancements, including a new high-definition scoreboard 2Â½ times bigger than the current one.

The new board will feature four large screens, offering three times the resolution of the screens on the existing one.

True North Sports & Entertainment unveiled the planned improvements on Monday. They also include:

Installation of a new 360-degree power ring presenting two times the resolution of the existing power ring .

Installation of a new state-of-the-art control room that will allow the production of high-definition images throughout the MTS Centre and improve audio in the existing sound system, and allow for additional cameras which will bring an enhanced scoreboard experience.

Installation of 278 new premium loge seats, accessed through the upper concourse and initially made available to patrons currently sitting in Row 1 of the 300 Level.

Installation of new seamless glass in the front row of the 300 Level, replacing the existing mesh railing, for improved sightlines for 300-level patrons.

The upgrades will be undertaken this summer.

MTS Centre, which opened Nov. 16, 2004, has hosted almost 1,400 events, including hockey games, concerts and other entertainment events.
