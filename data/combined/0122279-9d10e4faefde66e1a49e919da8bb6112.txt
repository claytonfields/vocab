I don’t ship anything that isn’t Trixie And Glimmy. They are probably the only characters in the entire show that I see and they just feel like they would be or are on the way of being a real couple. Something about their dynamic is just so charming and they both seem like they could help each other improve a lot as people. Also Trixie’s speech to Starlight at the end of all bottled up was wedding vows levels of shit along explicitly using the words “The Starlight I love” so casually and with passion on her voice. Hell, the fact that show is very careful about using the word “love” to the point where not even canon couples tend to say it much? Dude these two are a thing as far as I’m concerned.



Also trixie raises her hindleg on this gif down here, you know who raises their leg when hugging or kissing someone in fictional works as a trope? SOMEONE DOING SO TO THEIR LOVER. Checkmate atheists.
