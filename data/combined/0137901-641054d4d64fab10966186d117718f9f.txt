That's not a typo. No MVP has ever won the Most Improved Player award. It's kind of an absurd notion, when you think about it. How does the league's best player make the biggest improvement? But as great as the reigning MVP was a season ago, he's averaging almost nine points more per game this season. He's doing so at a historic level of efficiency, and he's on pace to break his own record for made 3s by more than 100. Curry has mastered the art of NBA shooting from places no one has ever regularly attempted shots before. (Runner-up: Andre Drummond, Detroit Pistons; Honorable mention: C.J. McCollum, Portland Trail Blazers; Avery Bradley, Boston Celtics; Dwight Powell, Dallas Mavericks)
