Interim name suppression has lapsed for Sainey Marong, who is accused of murdering Christchurch sex worker Renee Duckmanton.

Marong, understood to be from Gambia, is a 32-year-old butcher from Ilam, who is accused of murdering 22-year-old Duckmanton on May 14.

The dead woman's family have shouted threats and abuse at him at his appearances in the Christchurch District Court and High Court.

Her badly burnt body was found at the scene of a scrub fire on Main Rakaia Rd, north of Rakaia, about 7.40pm on May 15, the day after she was last seen on Manchester St, Christchurch.

Marong was granted interim name suppression at his first appearance on May 27.

That suppression lapsed on Tuesday, after defence counsel decided against further action to extend it.

Marong is scheduled to appear at a case review hearing in the High Court on August 19.
