More than half of GOP voters now view the outspoken billionaire in a good light, a Washington Post-ABC News survey released Wednesday found.

Fifty seven percent of Republicans see Trump favorably, versus 40 percent who do not.

The sampling also discovered that most voters still view the New York business mogul negatively.

Approximately 61 percent view Trump negatively, pollsters found, compared with 33 percent who do not.

Those results still show that Trump’s stock is rising, the Post said on Wednesday. He initially earned a 16 percent favorable rating, the newspaper noted, with 71 percent viewing him unfavorably, upon launching his campaign in June.

Trump entered the 2016 presidential race amid international controversy last month. The reality TV star sparked outrage by sharply criticizing Hispanic immigrants and Mexico during his announcement speech on June 16.

“They’re sending people who have a lot of problems,” Trump said during the address at Trump Tower in New York City.

“They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists,” he added.
