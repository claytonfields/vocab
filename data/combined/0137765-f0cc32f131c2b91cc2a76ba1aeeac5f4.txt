Now you have where you are going to put your plants, you can lay out the watering system.



1. Get a big barrel i had this laying around my house. Cut a hole into it big enough for the sub-pump to fit through.

2. Get a sub Pump this i got at a local swap-meet for 25 dollars (talked down from 45). It has a float shut off so if your water runs low it will stop, and not burn out your motor. it is a 500w, the size and strength depends on how far your going to push the water. This works more then enough for this project. And get a "dirty water" model as supposed to a clean water one so it has little legs to stand on inside the bucket, and wont suck its self to the bottom burning out the motor.



3.Take you tubing or small garden hose and connect them to the sub-pump most fit a garden hose, but i wanted to 3 small tubes, so i jammed three hoses into the cap that screws onto the pump. and filled it in with plumbers putty. Electrical taped the whole thing. I made these tubes just long enough to make it out of the barrel. This was so its easier to screw back on to the pump.



4. Put the pump tubing into the barrel fill barrel full of water (test pump see if you didn't get ripped off)
