Fiorentina weighing up Quag bid

By Football Italia staff

Fabio Quagliarella could be targeted by Fiorentina this summer, having become surplus to requirements at Juventus.

Tutto Mercato Web believe that the 29-year-old will leave the Bianconeri at the end of the season after the club announced the arrival of Fernando Llorente this afternoon.

The Spain international will sign on a free transfer from Athletic Bilbao, with Olympique Lyonnais forward Lisandro Lopez also being heavily linked with a move to Antonio Conte's side.

The arrival of both players will see Quagliarella on the fringes of the first team, something the Italy international will look to change by asking to leave the club.

The website claim that the Viola are favourites to sign the former Napoli man, with a bid of around â‚¬10m likely to be enough for his signature.
