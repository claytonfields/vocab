Review title of Deanne Thank you for still giving users time with this app

(for PC): While it's a decent bookmarking alternative, I dislike the layout and navigation. I'm disappointed that I can't import it into Edge, but it's understandable considering the circumstances. What I found insulting and misleading was the solution: open each link in Edge, one by one, save. It is the solution but it was poorly executed. Moving on, Importing the links as favorites and then manually/optionally saving it within the browser is clearly a better alternative. Ideally, I'd use Reading List as my default bookmarking as it appears to sync seamlessly. Edge is rather limited at this early stage of development. On that note, backing up and exporting favorites in Edge would be nice. (WP8.1) I like using this app on my phone. One request: Disable saving duplicates, if possible. Thank you. via WP10: When I wiped my PC's hard drive I assumed I'd lose my favorites saved to Edge. I was wrong. Importing Reading List into Edge also changed awhile ago. Thank you very much.
