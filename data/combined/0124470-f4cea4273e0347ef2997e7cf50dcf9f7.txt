However, uncertainty surrounds the aftermath of the Fenerbahce tie -- the first leg of which will be played in Turkey -- if the Turkish club win it.

Fenerbahce are awaiting a ruling from the Court of Arbitration for Sport over whether they will be allowed to progress to the competition proper after UEFA banned them over a domestic match-fixing scandal.

They were reinstated, pending their appeal to the CAS, the verdict of which is due to be announced before the draw for the group stages but after they have taken on Arsenal.

UEFA said it had not yet taken a decision on what would happen if Fenerbahce won the tie against Arsenal but then saw the CAS decision go against them.
