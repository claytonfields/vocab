Though testing for Alden Ehrenreich’s co-stars for the upcoming Han Solo spin-off has been slow and steady, the “Star Wars” anthology pic may be getting closer to adding another lead.

Sources tell Variety that “Selma” and “Creed” star Tessa Thompson, “Power Rangers” Naomi Scott, and Zoe Kravitz tested in London this week for the female lead in the yet-untitled project.

With production not starting till early 2017, directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller have taken their time in meeting with talent for the mystery female character as well as the role of Lando Calrissian. This would mark the second round of tests; a previous round took place earlier this summer. While it seems like a decision is on the horizon, sources it could still be a couple weeks till one is made.

As for the role of Calrissian, reports had surfaced that “Atlanta” star and creator Donald Glover was high on the list, but Disney and Lucasfilm still wanted a second round of tests to be certain on their decision. Solo’s friend was played by Billy Dee Williams in “The Empire Strikes Back” and “Return of the Jedi.”

The film is not only one of the more highly anticipated upcoming pics but also one of the more closely guarded projects in town. The casting of Solo was one of the largest and longest processes since Universal’s search for Christian Grey in “Fifty Shades of Grey.” Ehrenreich eventually won the part that Harrison Ford originated.

The pic is set to bow in theaters on May 25, 2018.
