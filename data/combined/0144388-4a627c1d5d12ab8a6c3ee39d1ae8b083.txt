With its hit high school dramedy, "Glee," on its last season, Fox is now looking at another possible musical series. The network is currently developing a remake of the South Korean limited series, "Answer Me 1997" for an American remake.

"Answer Me 1997" became a huge hit in South Korea, shooting its leads, singers and novice actors Seo In Guk and Jung Eun Ji into overnight superstars. It gained a massive fanbase and even gave birth to a sequel, "Answer Me 1994" which followed the same format and success.

"Answer Me 1997" is a coming-of-age musical centered around a group of high school kids. The flow of the series does not follow a chronological timeline, moving back and forth between the main character's young and adult life.

It follows the life of Shi Won (Jung) and her deep adoration for the hugely popular Kpop band, H.O.T., as well as her comedic and brutal romance with her best friend Yoon Jae.

Production is already underway at Fox, naming the American remake "Answer Me 1999." It is described as a musical journey by a group of friends as high school students in the late 1990s to their adult lives in the 2000s. It will most likely follow the Korean format but with a later but still definitive era.

Fox describes the American remake as "a musical journey through the most transformative decade of the modern era-one that catapulted us into the digital age and forever changed how we interact with each other."

With 1999 as the target date, the series will feature the pop culture during that era. Viewers would mostly likely relive the fashion and hear the music from iconic bands and singers of that time such as N'sync, Britney Spears, and even Destiny's Child.

Amy Andelson and Emily Meyer, who wrote Step Up 3D, will be working together with director Jon M. Chu for the pilot episode. They will also stand as executive producers for the anticipated series.
