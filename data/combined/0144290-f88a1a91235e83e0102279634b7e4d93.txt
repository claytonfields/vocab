â€” A woman and her son were shot Monday morning in a Rocky Mount neighborhood in an incident officials are calling a domestic dispute.

Court records show that Tonya Boyd, 43, had a temporary restraining order on file to protect her from 48-year-old Brian Vincent White. In her application, Boyd wrote that White told her there would be "a price to pay for stringing him along" and warned she could expect a "closed-casket funeral."

"She's been having trouble with this man for a long time," said a neighbor who was too scared to give her name.

Boyd and her 21-year-old son, Emmanuel Boyd, were shot in their front yard near the intersection of Westry Road and Primrose Place as they walked Boyd's younger son to the bus stop.

Both had surgery after the shooting, but authorities did not release additional information about their conditions. The younger boy was unhurt, police said.

Police charged White with two counts of attempted first-degree murder and violation of a protective order.

Tonya Boyd's friends in the neighborhood said she feared for her life, and that White routinely violated the protective order.

One woman said she heard the shots and ran outside to see her friend bleeding on the ground.

Police said, although the bus had arrived at the stop, no students were injured.
