Welcome to WikiProject College football! Our mission is to continually expand and improve Wikipedia's coverage of college football. This page and its subpages contain a forum for coordinating editors' efforts and building and maintaining quality and coherent style across all college football articles. If you would like to help, sign your name on the project participants list, visit our project's talk page, and check out the lists of requested tasks and articles in need of attention to see how you can help. Or give one of the participants listed below a shout if you have a question or need some direction.

For general information on WikiProjects, please see Wikipedia:WikiProject and Wikipedia:WikiProject Council/Guide.

Scope [ edit ]

As mentioned above, this project covers all aspects of college football including articles about college football history, the programs and traditions of individual schools, college football rivalries, notable games, awards, rankings and championship systems, and overviews of seasons on a national, conference, and individual team basis. Articles regarding the stadiums and venues, mascots, fight songs, and other pageantry that support college football teams or events are also included in the project. Biography articles for college football coaches, players, and other notable contributors such as journalists and sportscasters fall within the scope of this project. In many cases, such biography articles will also fall under the scope of WikiProject National Football League or other sports-related projects. In addition, articles that cover American football concepts and strategies that underwent significant development within the crucible of college football, such as touchdown, two-point conversion, or option offense, also fall under the purview of this project.

This project is limited to college football in the United States under the umbrella of the NCAA and the NAIA. At present, college football in Canada is organized under Wikipedia:WikiProject Canadian football—however, there are some colleges that participate in both Canadian Interuniversity Sport (CIS) and NAIA football. No other organized effort exists for non-American college football. If a need develops, a task force for British college football may be created. This project also does not cover junior college football, sprint football, or club teams. See WP:CFBTEAMS for more detail.

At present, effort is concentrated in the following areas (examples in parentheses):

Goals [ edit ]

Organizational

Create a set of standardized templates and article formats for coaches, teams, etc. Tag all college football articles, images, and other elements by placing the WikiProject College football template at the top of their talk pages. Categorize all college football articles into subcategories. Create subcategories for stubs and reclassify stubs into those subcategories. Find all college football stubs and label them.

Content

Make Wikipedia one of the premier online resources on college football. Bring College football to featured article status. Keep 2011 NCAA Division I FBS football season and related articles up to date, and maintain them as a reliable resource for enthusiasts during the season. Increase number of good articles and featured articles within the project.

Portal

Maintain Portal:College football and bring it to featured portal status.

Please place newest articles on the top

Articles in need of attention [ edit ]

Please feel free to ask for help from your fellow college football fans here (newer articles at the top, please).

Malone Stadium - This article need to be updates, there is not much information about this article. The stadium at UL-Monroe has lots of history and a new scoreboard was installed. The stadium also plans to get a new athletic complex built. Much more information would be great! WillAndersULM (talk) 01:06, 31 December 2013 (UTC)

Dynasty (sports) College football sections need a lot of cleanup and citations (note that in the context of this article that means citation not of championships or stats, but that a team has been called a dynasty by a reliable source). Also probably needs some correction; are Yale's 1874 to 1909 "championships" considered D-I FBS (or even NCAA?). Ideally this would be rewritten into prose (rather than list) discussion of college football dynasties.

Blue-Gray Football Classic- Needs some dressing up, and I don't think it's templated/categorized properly for this project. I'm on a small wikibreak, but I keep hearing this game referenced on sportstalk radio lately ('tis the season), so punting to here...

End, unfortunate such a once important position has such a paltry article. Cake (talk) 20:51, 25 February 2015 (UTC)

Backfield, same as above though "bundle of positions" if you will. Cake (talk) 20:22, 19 March 2015 (UTC)

Historically significant teams without articles [ edit ]

Project editors have established and maintained articles for all 127 current NCAA Division I FBS football programs. However, many lower division and defunct college football programs remain without standalone articles. For example, the following schools won national championships at the Division I or historically equivalent level or made important contributions to the sport, but do not currently have football articles:

World War II-era military service training programs

As of August 2016, over 38,000 articles and lists and more than 18,000 images, categories, templates and other support elements have been identified within the scope of WikiProject College football; see here. As such, there are too many college football articles on Wikipedia to list them all here. Below are categories that contain college football-related articles:

Category trees [ edit ]

The College football Wikiproject currently maintains Portal:College football and assists on an as-needed basis in the maintenance of Portal:American football. Editors are encouraged to submit and nominate content on both portals. Portal:College football/Selected Content/Nominations provides an overview of scheduled content and examples of what qualifies to be featured content. In addition, important college football events should be added to the College Football News section of the portal, which is also maintained by project members.
