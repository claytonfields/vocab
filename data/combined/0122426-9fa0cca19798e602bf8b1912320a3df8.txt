This patch prepares the grounds for the arrival of Hearthstone’s second exciting expansion: The Grand Tournament!

When The Grand Tournament goes live later this month, you’ll be able to arm yourself with 132 all-new cards, recruit chivalrous knights of all shapes and sizes, and have a whole lot of festive fun! This patch also begins tracking your highest earned rank in Ranked Play mode, and you’ll be rewarded with a Highest Rank Bonus at the end of the season. Remember, The Grand Tournament pre-purchase bundle remains available until the expansion goes live.

We’re also adding a new card back and fixing some bugs. The full patch notes are below!

General

The following card back has been added: Tournament Grounds – Acquired by reaching Rank 20 or higher in Ranked Play mode during the month of August.



New quests added, including one to win games in Tavern Brawl mode!

Tavern Brawl victories now count towards earning the Heroes of the Storm mount award.

A bonus chest will be granted at the end of each season based on the highest ranked reached in Ranked Play mode.
