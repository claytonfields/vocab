Mauthe said he took off the hat after an elections official asked him to, but he refused to turn his shirt inside-out. He added that he didn't know it was illegal to wear political attire to a polling place.

"You cannot express views for or against a candidate or political party by wearing buttons, T-shirts, hats, whatever else or carrying signs," Jaqua told the Express-News.

She said it's rare for someone to be arrested on an electioneering charge.

"Every election we have to advise people. â€¦ They wear candidates' shirts and we just have to remind them. 'Please go into the restroom and turn it inside out,'" she said. "This is the first time I recall someone getting arrested."

Mauthe was released from the Comal County Jail after posting $500 bond. If convicted of electioneering, a class C misdemeanor, he faces a fine of up to $500.
