BRISBANE Roar will form an affiliation with one of Europe’s most iconic clubs, Sporting Clube de Portugal, in a relationship set to include a player exchange program between the teams.

Roar managing director Daniel Cobb leaves for Europe later this week for meetings with a host of clubs.

Cobb was reluctant to reveal too much on Tuesday, but told The Courier-Mail that 18-time Primeira Liga winners Sporting were among the clubs he would visit to formalise the connection between the Roar and the Lisbon-based giants.

Cobb said the relationship would centre on academies, player development and player exchange.

Sporting’s famed academy developed three-time world player of the year Cristiano Ronaldo, as well as fellow Ballon d’Or winner Luis Figo.

Cobb arrived back in Brisbane on Tuesday from Jakarta, where he met with Roar owners the Bakrie Group, who will continue to commit funds to the club until a new consortium, being assembled by Cobb, is ready to take over the club.

The Roar’s medical staff, headed by Allsports director Tony Ganter, have returned to the club after quitting in May because of overdue wages that have since been paid by the club.

Cobb said the relocation of the club’s training and administration operations to Ballymore was imminent.

Despite the move, the Roar will retain a relationship with Griffith University, where the club currently train.

Cobb expected German fullback Jerome Polenz’s departure from the Roar to be finalised on Wednesday.

The Courier-Mail this week revealed the unwanted Polenz will leave the club with a year remaining on his contract.

Meanwhile, Roar pair Kye Rowles and Jayden Prasad have been named in a 23-man Young Socceroos squad for a July 18-21 training camp in Gosford.
