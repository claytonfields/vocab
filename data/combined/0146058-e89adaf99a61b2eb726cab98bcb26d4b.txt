Spotlight Series: Quickdraw, the Mech for Any Mission

History



The Quickdraw first rolled off the lines of Technicron Manufacturing and Luthien Armor Works in



Produced primarily in the Free Worlds League and the Draconis Combine, the various designs of the Quickdraw are common sights in the militaries of both of these Houses. It can also be found, in much lesser numbers, the militaries of both the Lyran Commonwealth and the Federated Suns. In a rare occurrence, Capellan pilots, who are traditionally loyal to Confederation designs, have also taken to the Quickdraw and favor the ‘Mech over other comparable or similar Capellan designs.



The popularity of the Quickdraw can be somewhat of a mystery due to the original design’s heat



Since its inception and initial production, the Quickdraw has become a mainstay of the battlefield, having seen action in nearly every major operation in the past 250+ years of service. Today new designs carry it into the future, past the Clan Invasion and the Jihad and into the Age of the Republic.



Notable Pilots



Major Jeffrey Saphara: In 3011, Leftenant-General Augst, a commander in the AFFS in the Sirdar Capella March theatre, decided to test his idle BattleMech units by raiding the planet Thomas. Thought to be tactically insignificant, Augst decided to treat the raid as a training exercise and sought to strategically outmaneuver the Capellan militia forces on the planet. Splitting his forces into two major elements, he dropped one half of his forces to meet the Capellans head-on and sent the other half to make planet fall behind the Capellan lines.



When he noticed the AFFS’s move, Major Saphara made a snap decision that would save countless lives. Wheeling his company, comprised primarily of light and medium ‘Mechs, he met the Davion charge head on. In his Quickdraw, Saphara was able to use the rough terrain of the Gienstal foothills to his company’s advantage. Through a combination of effective missile fire and hit and run tactics throughout the foothills, Saphara was personally credited with solo two solo kills on an enemy Orion and a JagerMech whilst also directing his company to concentrate on high priority targets. Colonel Gladys Turnbuckle officially credited Major Saphara’s quick thinking and superior command skills with saving the Capellan forces from what would otherwise have been a complete rout.



Hauptmann Kevin Jessup: Kevin was about to retire from a steady but unremarkable career in the LAAF when Natasha Kerensky’s Alpha Galaxy landed on Tamar in November of 3051. When Jessup’s commanding officer was killed in battle, control of the battalion fell to him. Caught between the palace of Duke Kelswa and Clan Wolf’s advancing Alpha Galaxy, Jessup simply gave the order to “stand and deliver.” The Second Battalion held their position in the city, slowing the Wolf advance and allowing Duke Kelswa’s Guards to orderly retreat before yielding the field to the Clan forces.



Weeks later, as Clan Wolf’s Beta Galaxy attacked Kobe, Leftenant General Kinders Green-Davion cited Jessup’s Second Battalion and their ability to remain cool under fire as a major factor in the unit’s survival of the engagement. Jessup was later wounded on Thurn and forced to retire against his will. All told, Jessup earned seven confirmed OmniMech kills across battle on three worlds while piloting his family’s unmodified QKD-4G Quickdraw.





MWO Variants







QKD – 4G



The original variant of the Quickdraw, the 4G historically suffers from heat issues. Armed with 4 Omicron 4000 Medium Lasers, 1 Delta Dart Long Range Missile 10 Rack, and 1 Hovertec Short Range Missile Quad, the 4G delivers adequate support at long range and ample close range firepower. Combined with jump jets, it is a highly mobile weapons platform.

Tonnage: 60

Engine: 300

Top Speed: 81 kph

Max Engine Rating: 360

Torso Movement:

100 degrees to each side.

25 degrees up and down.

40 degrees up and down.

Armor: 256 (Standard)

Internal Structure: Standard

Weapons & Equipment:

Left Arm: Medium Laser

Left Torso: LRM 10

Center Torso: SRM 4

Right Torso: Medium Laser x2

Right Arm: Medium Laser

Hardpoints:

Right Torso: 2 Energy

Right Arm: 1 Energy

Heat Sinks: 13 Single

ECM Capable?: No

Module Slots: 2

Quirks: +33% arm movement speed



The MWO version stays true to the design’s armament, with the notable exception that, like in all cases of BattleMechs that have come to the online stage, the two rear facing medium lasers instead face forward. This makes for an even more devastating salvo of missile and laser fire, but it also intensifies the model’s heat issues. Note that the 4G has 33% faster arm speed movement.







QKD-4H



The only notable exception in the 4H model was a swapping of forward and rear firing weapons. The SRM pack and the two rear firing medium lasers switched postions, making it possible for the pilot to bring all four medium lasers to bear on a forward arc target while also still covering the rear arc with the SRM pack.

Note that the 4H has an additional Missile Hardpoint in the Left Torso.







QKD-5K



During the Clan invasion, Luthien Armor Works released a new model of the Quickdraw. Replacing the LRM rack with two additional Medium Lasers, Luthien also decided to upgrade the heat sinks. With seventeen double heat sinks, the 5K has virtually none of the heat dissipation problems that plagued earlier variants. The 5K also sports Ferro-Fibrous armor and retains its predecessors’ speed and jump capability.

The Quickdraw adds some badly needed mobility and brawling options to the heavy ‘Mech line-up of Mechwarrior Online and could easily stand in for some ‘Mechs either a weight class higher or a weight class lower than it depending on how it is configured. As far as impact on the game, the Quickdraw’s could end up being very significant as jump jets become less of a way to pop tart and jump snipe and more of a method to achieve tactical battlefield superiority and mobility.

The Quickdraw first rolled off the lines of Technicron Manufacturing and Luthien Armor Works in2779. Originally intended to replace the Rifleman, the Quickdraw instead soon made a name for itself as a generalist ‘Mech, often deployed and used in a variety of different battlefield roles.Produced primarily in the Free Worlds League and the Draconis Combine, the various designs of the Quickdraw are common sights in the militaries of both of these Houses. It can also be found, in much lesser numbers, the militaries of both the Lyran Commonwealth and the Federated Suns. In a rare occurrence, Capellan pilots, who are traditionally loyal to Confederation designs, have also taken to the Quickdraw and favor the ‘Mech over other comparable or similar Capellan designs.The popularity of the Quickdraw can be somewhat of a mystery due to the original design’s heatdissipation problems, but it is possible because of the ‘Mech’s ability to handle many different battlefield situations, including long range engagements, short range brawls, and running battles where maneuverability is key, that makes the BattleMech stand out from other similar designs.Since its inception and initial production, the Quickdraw has become a mainstay of the battlefield, having seen action in nearly every major operation in the past 250+ years of service.
