Galak-Z developer 17-bit's turn-based strategy game Skulls of the Shogun is getting an animated series.

Hosted by Nerdist, the show will star John DiMaggio (Bender from Futurama, Marcus Fenix from Gears of War) as General Akamoto, an Edo-era military general betrayed by his comrades on the eve of his greatest victory. It will also co-star Gary Anthony Williams (The Boondocks) and Jessica Chobot (Mass Effect 3) along with director F. Ryan Naumann.

Our Chris Donlan boldly claimed that Skulls of the Shogun "earns its place amongst the genre's greats."

"Fast, compact and yet consistently thoughtful, there's nothing else quite like Skulls of the Shogun," he wrote in his glowing Skulls review upon its arrival on Xbox 360 in 2013. It's also available on PC, Mac, Linux, PS4, Windows Phone, and iOS and Android platforms.

The Skulls of the Shogun animated series will premiere Tuesday, 11th August at 6pm UK time. Here's a preview:
