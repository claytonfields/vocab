The Indiana Pacers ended the Brooklyn Nets’s three-game winning streak tonight by winning 110-85 . Check out the recap below.

The Good: 110 points. Wow. The offense was great. Seven players were in double-figures and C.J. Watson, Rodney Stuckey and David West scored 17 or more.

Pacers took full advantage of the Nets and ran away with it in the second half. They also held Brook Lopez to zero points on 0-5 shooting.

Oh, and the Brooklyn Nets DJ played great music per usual.

The Bad: Some guy decided to smell Lavoy Allen’s jersey. Weird.

MVP: Rodney Stuckey had a great night. He filled the stat-sheet, attacked the rim, got to the free-throw line and worked on defense. Not to mention he did all of this after suffering a facial contusion yesterday.

LVP: The Nets defense.
