Observation and Imagination

Our cartoon artists spend a lot of time observing the world around them whether it is people, nature, species or things. They even observe the color, texture, contrast, and emotion. Through their observations, they set their imagination free. At times, these artists look relax and gaze into empty space but their mind might actually be working.

Creating a sketch

After spending a lot of time on observation and imagination, a carton artist then starts off with a sketch.

An Important Message Through Arts

“Art is not what you see, but what you make others see.” - Edgar Degas, the famous 19th century French Artist.

All artists, including cartoon artists, possess a deep understanding of a true nature. The arts can express from joy and love to anger and frustration.

Our cartoon artists hope to keep coming up with the arts that would be simple, cute, and yet meaningful. Baby Jen and all the animal characters from Endanzoo are drawn based on real life characters. Through these one-of-a-kind arts on the children’s clothing, we hope to inspire the future generations to connect to endangered species and convey an important message: SAVE SPECIES FROM EXTINCTION.
