Mediaite reports:

In the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal, the skeletons in other celebrities’ closets have been coming out.

He suggested one woman “use two hands” and jokingly said “maybe it’d be easier if you put your mouth on it.”

Kimmel asked another woman how old she was, which she said 18.

“Are you sure?” Kimmel replied. “Because Uncle Jimmy doesn’t need to do time.”

When one of his contestants was aggressively feeling around his pants, he told her “You’re gonna make a fine wife.”

In the end, he revealed what he had in his pants: a zucchini with a rubber band on it.
