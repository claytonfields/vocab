from Bob McKenzie of TSN,

Victoria's Joe Hicketts is the only defenceman invited to this camp who wasn't invited to the summer camp. At 5-foot-8 and 175 pounds, he's not blessed with extraordinary size or speed, and the 1996-born blueliner wasn't drafted by an NHL team last summer.

But after attending Detroit's summer prospect camp, and then getting invited to the Wings' rookie tournament team in Traverse City, the undrafted free agent sufficiently impressed the Wings to get an NHL contract. He's been an offensive dynamo in the WHL this season.

With seven goals and 36 points in 28 games, he leads all WHL defencemen in scoring, but he's fifth amongst all players in the WHL. It doesn't hurt that Lowry, who will handle the defencemen for Groulx, is Hicketts' head coach in Victoria.

For a defenceman of that stature in the WJC, Hicketts doesn't have the same dynamic qualities to his game as, say, Ryan Ellis in 2009 and 2010, but he has a scrappy get-things-done mentality and puts up points.
