'Deutschland '83' star Jonas Nay takes best actor in Germany's version of the Emmys.

Nazi drama Naked Among Wolves and hospital drama The Red Band Society were the big winners at Germany's version of the Emmys, taking the best TV movie and best series honors, respectively.

Jonas Nay won the best actor honor for his portrayal of East German spy Martin Rauch in the Cold War drama Deutschland '83, while Ina Weisse won the best actress award for playing a wife and mother who falls for another woman in the TV movie I Want You.





German public broadcasters again dominated the German TV Awards, with ZDF winning best comedy show for long-running cabaret series Die Anstalt and best late show for news satire program Neo Magazin Royale.

It also locked up awards for best director (Lars Becker for TV movie Too Early to Die) and best screenplay (Magnus Vattrodt for A Great Awakening). Aside from Nay's win, the only commercial network series represented in the fiction categories was crime series Mordkommission Berlin 1, which won tech awards for best music and best set design.



Public network ARD and its regional affiliates won the bulk of the news and information categories, though commercial network Vox won the best factual entertainment show for the local version of reality format Shark Tank.
