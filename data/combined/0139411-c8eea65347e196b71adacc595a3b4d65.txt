A strong bomb woke up Cairo around 6:20 a.m. local time Saturday. The bomb was strong enough to be felt and heard across the city.

Photos taken after the explosion show the main target was an Italian government building. It is being variously described as a consulate or center. A photo of the Italian government’s Da Vinci International School matches photos of the blown up building seen in photos taken Saturday morning.

Photo-journalist David Degner posted several photos from the scene to Twitter:
