An employee of Montreal's La Ronde amusement park who strayed into a restricted area while doing repairs was killed Friday by a passing roller-coaster train.

Ambulance workers treated numerous clients of the ride and employees for shock after the incident.

The 67-year-old employee was declared dead immediately and there were no efforts to revive him because of the obvious extent of his injuries.

La Ronde said the ride will be closed indefinitely pending an investigation.

A spokesman for the amusement park said investigators want to know why the employee was in the tightly controlled area while he worked.

The park said preliminary findings show the ride was operating properly, the area where the employee was found was secure and the man did not notify the ride operator of his movements.

"Our thoughts and prayers go out to our team member's family," the park said in a statement.
