After watching Frozen hundreds of times, it has started to rub off on most things in our life. We want every snowman to talk, we appreciate clothes with rosemaling, and we want to be awake when the sky is awake. We’ve also noticed that some of our favorite Disney males are what the trolls would call, “fixer uppers.” With that said, here are some other Disney males who could use a little help, inspired by our favorite fixer upper, Kristoff.

Beast



He could use some tips on personal grooming.

Mickey



For obvious reasons, Mickey is often late for dates with Minnie.

Simba



It takes Nala, Rafiki, and a powerful chat with spirit Mufasa to talk Simba into becoming the king he is destined to be.

Tarzan



Some extra classes in social behavior wouldn’t hurt.

Prince Naveen



It wasn’t until he turned full frog that he became a true gentlemen.

Kuzco



Kuzco wouldn’t agree with us on this, but he could use a lesson or two in manners.

Eeyore



He should learn to stop losing his most valuable possession.

Flynn Rider



Thief on a wanted poster with a funny nose? Our moms would not be happy about (early) Flynn.

Aladdin



We love street rat Aladdin, but we don’t support stealing.

Hans



This is an obvious one. Although, we’d like to think that if Hans didn’t let power cloud his judgement things could have ended differently.

To conclude:

♫ So he’s a bit of a fixer-upper,

but this we’re certain of:

You can fix this fixer-upper

Up with a little bit of love! ♫
