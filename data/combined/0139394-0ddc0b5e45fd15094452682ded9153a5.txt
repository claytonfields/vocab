Hundreds marched in the streets of Capitol Hill in Seattle in support of William Wingate, the 70 year old Air Force Veteran who walks with a golf club as a cane. Mr. Wingate, who is black, was arrested by SPD officer Whitlatch, who is not, for allegedly swinging his golf club at her vehicle as she drove past. Dash cam evidence proved otherwise and officer Whitlatch has been put on paid, administrative leave, as Mr. Wingate sues the Seattle Police Department for arresting him without cause.

“Walking While Black”

Always Dangerous Until Proven Otherwise

On Saturday, February 7th at 2:00p.m., you are invited to bring your Woods, Irons, Wedges and Putters and join us at Cal Anderson Park Shelterhouse, 1635 11th Avenue, for “Walking While Black” Always Dangerous Until Proven Otherwise

WE WALK to finish the interrupted walk of a 69 year old Black Veteran/Civil Servant who on July 9, 2014, grabbed his putter and set out on a brilliant summer day. A day that would forever change both he and this city we call home.

WE WALK because when it comes to police misconduct and black men, there are no local issues, just one long and painful history of bad cops who think it’s okay to dole out harsh and sometimes even deadly punishments to black men they deem to have stepped out of line.

WE WALK because we are tired of our keys, wallets, cellphones and candy bars being seen as guns.

WE WALK because the youthful indiscretion period for young black males, continues to plummet, now hovering somewhere around age twelve.

WE WALK because we are tired of government restricting and monitoring the movement of Black Folks: Be it the Middle Passage, Slavery, Jim Crow, Segregation, Intimidation, Montgomery, Selma or Seattle.

WE WALK because blackness and criminal behavior are so merged in the American mind, that regardless of who you are, where you came from, or what you’ve accomplished, in the eyes of many, being black and male is sufficient probable cause.

AND SO WE WALK, LIKE GARVEY, LIKE MALCOM, LIKE NAT TURNER, LIKE CORETTA, LIKE KUNSTLER, LIKE SOJOURNER, LIKE TUBMAN, LIKE ALL THOSE WHO CAME BEFORE, AND ALL THOSE YET TO COME. WE WALK!

PLEASE READ: While we understand and appreciate the intersection of various social justice movements, we also believe there are times to direct our focus on a specific issue. This is one of those times. While the walk is open to all—people of color as well as allies—we request that all participants keep their focus on this specific issue: law enforcement’s racism against black males. In this case, we feel that highlighting other issues of injustice, even those involving law enforcement, will serve only to dilute our message. Thank you for your support and respect.”
