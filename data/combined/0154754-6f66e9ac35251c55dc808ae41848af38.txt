Have you ever wanted to sneak a taste—and just a taste—of that 1998 Opus cabernet in your cellar? Opening the bottle would require a special occassion, since you'd be committing to drinking the whole thing. But with the Coravin, you can just drink a glass today and preserve the rest of the bottle for later.

The Coravin lets you open a bottle of wine without actually opening it. The Coravin Model Two uses a hollow needle that pokes through the cork; wine pours through the needle and into your glass. The negative space in the bottle is filled with argon, an inert, tasteless, and odorless gas. By pumping argon into the bottle—and by keeping the O 2 out—your leftover wine won't oxidize, and will continue to age and mature in the bottle until you're ready to consume the rest. The cork stays in place the whole time, and since it's compressed with pressure from the bottle's neck, that needle hole seals up tight when you remove the Coravin.
