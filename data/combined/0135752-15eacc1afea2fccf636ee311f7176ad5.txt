Hello Ivan. We run a PageSpeed test through webpagetest.org, you can see the results below: First Try: http://www.webpagetest.org/result/170825_BZ_a9a95e3b8cc47a1a4c5c73c99a197a1d/ Second Try: http://www.webpagetest.org/result/170825_3P_7315181de953ce100fe832fd17eaf13c/ Those PageSpeed tests show that your site is faster than most of the sites out there but you can still optimize its total loading time, specifically for the ranks marked as "F". Both of our Maintenance Plans offer PageSpeed Optimization, Support and Updates while the Ninja one has some extra services related to security like Malware Scanning and Cleaning. Feel free to take a look at our Maintenance Plan page, if you haven't done this already, and send me any additional questions or comments you may have: https://fixmywp.com/wordpress-maintenance-services ps: I come from Greece but we have people working from us from Serbia and the US as well so you can get a reply from our support department all day(and night) long. -- Makis.

Hi Ivan, Typically, our ability to help with speed optimization is limited to a few things: installing/configuring a caching plugin like WP Super Cache (if your host allows caching plugins; some hosts block these in favour of their own server-side caching systems), installing and configuring a minification/concatenation plugin like Autoptimize, and installing/configuring an image optimization/compression plugin like TinyPNG (free for up to 500 optimizations per month). For any deeper optimization efforts, you'll need to work with your host and/or a service specifically offering site optimization. We can certainly provide basic troubleshooting for other issues as needed, and can generally address those as part of a subscription - although there will sometimes be issues that need to be addressed by the specific plugin/theme vendor. Our team is distributed, but we're headquartered near Atlanta, GA. Our support hours are currently 7am to 5pm US Eastern, Monday to Friday. Our goal for turnaround time on support/task requests is 8 business hours; actual turnaround time will vary depending on a number of factors, but is typically closer to 3-4 business hours. Please let us know if you have any other questions! Thanks, -- Lucas Karpiuk Happiness Engineer, GoWP Support 770-691-6272

Hi Marko, nice to meet you and thanks for your interest in total wp support. Can you send me your site so i can have a look and do a quick assessment of your sites current speed issues? We can certainly help you out with your speed problems. The extent to which we can assist from within the costings of the maintenance plan does have its limitations, depending on the plan you choose. Generally, maintenance plans are all about maintaining the site you have. Extensive work to fix speed issues are generally outside the scope of a plan. That said, MOST websites speed issues are fairly easily fixed and come down to one or a combo of a few different factors. - poor quality hosting

- no caching on server side or site side

- no cdn used

- too many plugins

- poorly built website The first four items are most likely the root cause of your issues and assessing and fixing those will most likely provide the boost your site needs to meet your speed requirements. All of those are things we can do for you. We provide extremely high quality hosting that includes very aggressive caching on all levels. Most sites see a dramatic immediate boost after switching to our hosting. Our hosting also makes it very easy and affordable to set up and run a CDN for your images and other assets. We can help assess what plugins are causing the greatest slow downs and help to deactivate and delete plugins that aren't needed. The only part that isn't included in sites that are hosted with us and on a maintenance plan would be actually getting in and fixing the more advanced issues like the technical aspects of the sites development. In these cases we simply work to a set quote that is acceptable with the client. If you have further questions, let me know, happy to set up a phone call if needed to discuss further. All the best Bodhi

Hi Ivan, Thank you for reaching out to us. Our corporate office is in Springville Utah but we are a remote company and have employees located within North America. A great way to find out what exactly is slowing your site down would be to purchase one of our SiteChecks. We will evaluate your hosting, theme, plugins, media, site speed and security to determine what is slowing everything down and provide you with a report and steps on what we can do to speed it up for you. You can also purchase one of our plans so that we are proactively taking care of your site. We offer the following support and maintenance plans: Our Protect Plan is a preventative maintenance package that covers all of the most important parts of your website, like realtime backups, update management (to make sure you're always running the latest versions of everything), and realtime malware scanning and removal. It's $99 per month, or $79 per month if you choose annual billing. Our Professional Plan offers all of the services that the Protect Plan does, but also includes uptime monitoring (if your site ever goes offline we'll know immediately and will start working to bring it back online), a staging area where all updates are tested, version control with Github, and two hours of development time each month. That plan is $399 per month, or $299 if you choose annual billing. (minimum plan required for eCommerce) You are able to buy development time from us on both plans (for anything that falls outside of what's included in each plan), for an additional $125 per hour. Would you like to get started with a SiteCheck? Which of these plans seems like the best fit for your needs? Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Hello Marko The straight answer is yes we can speed up your site. However we like to do a review of your site for free first and then give you a full report on the condition of your website, our advice on fixing those issues and your options in regards to either a monthly plan or a single fix price. If you would like to proceed with the site review please create an admin user as wpsupport_si46 and the email clientacct@wpsupportservices.co.uk And then email us the site link and password to clientacct@wpsupportservices.co.uk and we will have a full report sent back to you by tomorrow. The company is based in the UK but we have both staff and clients on 4 continents. Regards David Finch WP Engineer

Ivan, I've reviewed your website/issue/project and in order to complete this, it would be an hourly job. I recommend our monthly WordPress Management packages as they include a preset amount of support hours and additional hourly rates are preferential. They also include a suite of crucial services for the overall health of your website such as daily backups, software/plugin updates, malware scans, performance reports, keyword tracking, uptime monitor and more. If you would prefer a one-time quote, I've added information about hourly retainer billing at the bottom of the message. We have four levels of monthly management available: ESSENTIALS ? 30 Mins Support Time From $79/month https://www.wpsync.com/account/cart.php?a=add&pid=273 PREMIUM ? 2 Hours Support Time From $179/month https://www.wpsync.com/account/cart.php?a=add&pid=260 ULTIMATE ? 4 Hours Support Time From $279/month https://www.wpsync.com/account/cart.php?a=add&pid=261 PARTNER - 10 Hours Support Time From $799/month https://www.wpsync.com/account/cart.php?a=add&pid=262 In all the plans additional time is billed at $75/hour, which is invoiced on Mondays for the previous weeks overage. For example, if you had the 2-hour "Premium" plan and used 2 hours 15 minutes, you would receive an invoice for the extra 15 minutes ($18.75). It's also worth noting that these monthly packages are not locked into a contract, you can downgrade or cancel at the end of the current billing cycle. If you are not interested in a monthly commitment, we also offer hourly retainer billing. These are single hours purchased at full-rate, so do not offer quite as much value as the monthly packages. To purchase a retainer hour for your project please click here: https://www.wpsync.com/account/cart.php?a=add&pid=331 Once your payment is approved, you will be redirected to our support system. There you can securely provide credentials so that we can begin our work. I'll be happy to answer any questions. - Thomas Customer Support
