I got lots of wonderful things, and they were all wrapped -so fun! I got:

a big sketch book (how did my match know I was on the last page of my old one? awesome timing)

a pack of Micron pens for drawing. My old ones had dried out, so also awesome!

A National Audubon Society Guide to Nature Photography (digital). Perfect! I love doing nature photography and I'm a beginner. I've been trying to figure out how to get better and this is exactly what I needed.

A Falcon Guide to the Best Easy Day Hikes near my Oklahoma City. I love hiking and I just moved here, so this will be great for helping me explore the area and find good hiking spots!

Thank you so much Legotech! These were all very thoughtful gifts, you are awesome!
