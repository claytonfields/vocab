A portion of a DualShockers interview with producer Kenichiro Takaki...

DS: Since we’re talking about the latest consoles, are you interested in working on Nintendo NX?

KT: I’m very interested in the NX too, and I’d like to eventually work on the console.

DS: You worked with Nintendo before. Your games seem the kind of titles that Nintendo would feel awkward about. After all, they even censor their own games. Did they ever give you problems about the content of Senran Kagura?

KT: There weren’t actual restrictions, or anything that they actually told me not to do, but I did feel the pressure from Nintendo. But, you know, after we discussed so many times, we managed to make it happen.

With the first game there was a lot of confusion on Nintendo’s part, because they didn’t really know the gameplay, and they only saw the sexy side. Yet, after they saw what the actual gameplay was like, they didn’t have any problem because they knew what the game was all about. For Senran Kagura 2 it wasn’t that hard.
