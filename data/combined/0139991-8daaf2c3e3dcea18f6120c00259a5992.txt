M Musical, the company behind forthcoming performance “Zorro: The Musical,” has confirmed the lead actors of SHINee’s Key, BEAST’s Yoseob, solo star Wheesung, AOA member Choa, and musical actor Kim Woo Hyung for the musical. Promotional posters of the stars have also been released to the media.

Key has already had experience in musicals, and recently performed in “The Three Musketeers” and “Bonnie and Clyde.” Yoseob has also appeared in productions, such as “Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.” Kim Woo Hyung is famous for his roles in the Korean renditions of “Les Misérables” and “Ghost.”

The four male stars will take it in turns to perform the title role, that of a masked, do-gooding outlaw, whose real name is Diego. Choa, meanwhile, will play Zorro’s love interest, Luisa.

The Korean production follows a successful debut for the musical in the United Kingdom, and productions in the United States, Israel, and Russia.

M Musical representatives have explained that Korean musical fans can expect certain differences, however. A spokesperson said, “Our version is not exactly the same as the original. We are trying to make the individual characters as vivid as possible.

“Zorro: The Musical” will be performed at Seoul’s Chungmu Art Hall. The opening night is scheduled for August 27, and performances run until October 26.
