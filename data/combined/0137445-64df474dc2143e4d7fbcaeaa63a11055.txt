Here's a little project I've had going for a while. I had the lineart done before Sai crapped out on me. Now that I fixed the problem I've been able to work on it again. I'm pretty pleased with this, although the glow trails looked a lot better as sketches.I started re-watchign Digimon Adventure 02, but in Japanese this time. Ken has always been my favorite character, and since both he and Fluttershy represent Kindness, I thought why not draw them together. In a not crack-pairing way of course. I do friend-ship these two, though. I think they'd get along well. Also, the Digimon symbol of Kindness looks suspiciously like Fluttershy's head.I love these two so much.MLP (c) Hasbro, Studio B and all the fantastic people who work on the showDigimon (c) ... I have no idea. :/ It's a complex franchise.
