Trustees from Kingston Mosque have expressed concern after a fire ravaged south London's largest mosque last week.

More than 70 firefighters battled the blaze at Morden's Baitul Futuh Mosque on Saturday.

Kingston Mosque suffered a similar fate earlier this year when a fire left the East Road building's internal structure gutted and the building unusable over the summer.

Trustee Faisal Hanjra said: "We were very concerned to hear about the events in Morden. Especially given concerns around a possible arson attack.

"Having been through this ourselves we can very much empathise with their situation. We wish the community the very best in their efforts to get to the bottom of the cause."

The investigation into the fire at Kingston Mosque is yet to be completed, he added.

In a demonstration of community spirit in Kingston, St Luke's Church and St John Bunyan Church took in congregations of Muslim worshippers during prayer times.

During the month of Ramadan ahead of the Muslim celebration of Eid, Kingston College also opened its doors to larger groups to be able to pray in its sports hall.

Meanwhile the mosque launched an emergency appeal to restore the building raising Â£80,000.

Although the community was able to move back into the building a month after the fire, refurbishments are yet to be fully completed.

A 14 year old boy arrested in connection with the fire at the Baitul Futuh has been bailed until January.

Another 16 year old that was arrested has been released with no further action.

Police have said there is no evidence the fire was related to a hate crime.

Kingston Mosque is attended by muslims from the Suni sect and the Morden mosque is used by members of the Ahmadiyya community, known for their "love for all, hatred for none" slogan that survived the fire.
