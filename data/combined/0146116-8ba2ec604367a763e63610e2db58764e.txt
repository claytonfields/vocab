Has anyone here even seen a chicken? Because you might want to learn to dance like one so that you can properly celebrate.

Just a few days after actor Peter Serafinowicz said that 'Arrested Development' creator Mitch Hurwitz was writing the long-awaited film to the tragically cancelled sitcom, the GOB-father himself is confirming the news -- and even one-upping Serafinowicz in the great scoop department.

Hurwitz told Digital Spy that he is in fact writing the film -- and hopes to get it produced and released within the year. He's just not making too big of a deal of it yet, given his fans' emotional commitment and fervor to the project.

"But I don't like to toy with the affections of our fans," he said. "They've been so supportive and we're so grateful, so I kind of hate to answer the question until I can say, 'Yep, we've shot it, it opens next week'. Otherwise it feels like we're toying with people and we do not mean to do that. It has just taken a while to get it going."

Regardless, even a glimmer of hope is good news for 'Arrested' fans, who have been waiting -- nay, praying for -- a film since FOX canceled the series in 2006. It's been a rocky road, to say the least.

In February 2009, it was reported that breakout star Michael Cera was a roadblock to the film, but a month later, it seemed all systems go.

In June 2010, star David Cross said it wasn't happening, but after Serafinowicz, and earlier, Ron Howard, gave fans hope, we hear from the horse's mouth that all systems are go.
