So is this god tree different from the tree in the FKF or the same? Was it even stated what the name of the tree in he FKF was called? If not then maybe the god tree is that tree.



I'm also curious if gloxinia's ability is similar to Kings in that it gives her control life and death. I mean it would be kind of redundant but perhaps it's an ability unique to only the FK's? Of course I could be wrong and she actually has an entirely different ability.



Wonder if she recognizes king (not saying they met) but from his appearance and demeanor? She could probably tell from his PL as well seeing as how see could tell his PL doubled to take out the albion. Will she ask king about his wings? Will she tell him the secret behind sprouting wings or reveal something shocking about the FK's and/or King? Speaking.of wings what happened to hers? Did she lose them after becoming a demon? Are they hidden away in her body and that she can sprout them whenever she wants?



So apparently there are multiple spirit spears? Now that's interesting. Perhaps there's more to this weapon that it looks. I can't wait to find out what the deal is. Also, is there any chance we'll get a Mel history lesson albeit a brief one?
