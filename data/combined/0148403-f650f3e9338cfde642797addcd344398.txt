MONTREAL – The Montreal Impact announced on Tuesday that it will help the victims of severe flooding in the Greater Montreal Area and in many regions of Quebec.

“Our hearts go out to the victims and to all people affected by these floods,” said Montreal Impact President Joey Saputo. “It is crucial, for me and for our entire organization, to support our community. All together, we can contribute in helping those who are going through some tough times in several areas in Quebec.”

For every ticket sold for the game against Columbus Crew SC this Saturday, May 13, the club will donate $1 to the Canadian Red Cross. The Impact is thus calling on all its supporters to help.

In Quebec, the Red Cross is helping over 1,400 people in need. Depending on the needs of individuals and families, the Red Cross is providing support such as relocating people to hotels and providing them with food vouchers.

To date, more than 100 Red Cross volunteers have been assisting each day in flood-impacted areas. Additional volunteers are on stand-by, ready to assist, if needed.
