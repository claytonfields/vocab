One of the country’s most prominent DREAMers believes that President Barack Obama needs to enact another round of executive amnesty even after she revealed that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said her illegal immigrant mother would be allowed to stay in the country.

Appearing on MSNBC with José Diaz Balart, Erika Andiola, who has confronted Republicans like Rep. Steve King (R-IA) about immigration, said her mother faces possible deportation but, “I was told by ICE she was going to be able to stay.”

Obama has recently emphasized that though his executive amnesty only covers about five million illegal immigrants, most of the seven million illegal immigrants not formally covered and who have not committed violent crimes will not face deportation.

Andiola was hopeful that since Obama had said “over and over again” that he could not unilaterally change the country’s immigration laws before enacting his executive amnesty, he could in the future enact another executive amnesty even though Obama said he did as much as White House lawyers told him he could do under law. Andiola said that Obama needed “better attorneys,” because “tons of attorneys” have told her that Obama could enact more executive actions to formally provide temporary amnesty to millions of more illegal immigrants.
