Absolut Vodka released a commercial with a transgender storyline this month that has gained almost 600,000 views on YouTube.

The commercial, titled “Darla,” is part of the vodka brand’s #AbsolutNights campaign. A man at a music festival bumps into his old friend Dave who has now transitioned into a woman called Darla. The man is hesitant to reconnect, but Darla grabs his hand.

The pair dance together, take pictures, watch a parade and drink Absolut Vodka. At the end of the night, Darla opens up about her transition.

“We walked, and she told me she always felt this way,” the man says in a voiceover. “I just listened, and somehow I understood.”

“She was my friend. The same person. The same heart. She hadn’t changed. I had,” the man continues. The newfound friends embrace and walk off together.

“When was the last time you were true to yourself? Sometimes being open to new possibilities is all it takes,” the campaign’s tagline reads.
