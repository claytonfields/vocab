One man’s attempt to end his life turned into a pretty disastrous night for many others on the Braddell flyover of the Central Expressway (CTE) yesterday, The New Paper reports.

Due to the actions of a suicidal 38-year-old man, a chain reaction caused an accident between a van, a Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) Red Rhino and an ambulance. Moments after that accident, a car crashed into the rear of a taxi nearby.

It all started when the SCDF and police were alerted to the case of attempted suicide on the CTE flyover around 2.45am last night. The Red Rhino light fire attack vehicle was parked on the road shoulder when a van collided into it, and an ambulance got damaged in the collision as well.

The impact also caused the van to skid before toppling on its side. Ten metres away from the crash site, a car ploughed into the back of a taxi in a separate accident.



A total of three people were injured — the 69-year-old van driver, a 20-year-old SCDF officer and a female passenger of the car. They all got treatment at Tan Tock Seng Hospital.

As you can imagine, it was total chaos, affecting four whole lanes on the CTE in the direction towards Seletar Expressway (SLE). The suicidal man who started it all was arrested by the police that night (and probably horrified at what he caused).
