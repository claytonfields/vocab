Google removed from the Google play store a widget that displayed quotes by Meir Kahane, leader of Israel’s extreme-right political party Kach.

According to a report in +972 Magazine, right-wing activist Baruch Marzel posted on his Facebook page that the application, which can be installed on a smartphone's home screen, displays up to a thousand quotes by Kahane, whose party was banned from the Knesset in 1988 and outlawed in 1994. Among other things, Kahane is known for saying that there is no Palestinian people.

On Sunday, the application had been downloaded between 50 and 100 times from the Play Store. Although Google did not officially confirm it had taken down the application, and added it does not comment on specific applications, the Kahane app was not available for download on Monday.
