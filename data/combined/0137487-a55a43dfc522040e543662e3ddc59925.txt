One man was injured after a stabbing at the Mill Woods Town Centre Saturday morning.

The incident happened at the mall food court just after 11 a.m.

Police said an 18-year-old was taken to the U of A hospital with serious injuries.

Officers and a canine team have been searching the area but police would not release any details.

Residents said they were surprised and concerned about the incident.

"I walked in and there was police tape everywhere and you could see the blood stains right there," Troy Falk told CTV News.

He said he had heard there had been a fight next to the children's play area but didn't realize how serious it was.

"Oh, of course. And in a food court, how many kids seen it? You know."

Shopper Julie Hink said she often brings her grandchildren to the Centre but was now concerned.

"I want to be able to find a safe place in winter where we can be and I'm horrified to think that that could happen so close," she said adding that it destroyed her trust of the area.

Other shoppers agreed.

"I'm disgusted," Karen Tober said.

"My first thought was this is Mill Woods then that conjures up a whole bunch of impressions for people because Mill Woods has been called murder woods," she added.

Some have even said there needed to be better security at shopping centres.

"There should be adequate police presence there to avoid this kind of incident," Sandeep Luthera said.
