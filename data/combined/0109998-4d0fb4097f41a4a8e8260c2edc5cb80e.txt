Installing a Bob’s F-100 Parts Four-Bar Setup |

A week or so ago I was running an errand for the missus when I happened to drive right by Bob’s F-100 Parts. As I did, it occurred to me that it’d been ages since I’d stuck my nose in Bob’s door, and if I didn’t do it now there’d be no tellin’ when I might get around to it again. So, the better half’s errand slipped to the back burner and I turned around and pulled into Bob’s.

As I stuck my head into the shop door I found Bob and Chuck (one of his crew members) underneath a bright-red F-100. Busybody that I am, I wandered under the pickup as well and asked what was goin’ on. As luck would have it I’d stopped by just as the pair was about to install one of Bob’s four-bar setups so I decided to hang around and watch somebody else work for once. Bob explained that the truck’s owner was less than pleased with the pickup’s ride quality and performance afforded by the old, OEM leaf spring suspension and he’d heard through the grapevine that Bob’s four-bar setup was the way to go. Bob was happy to oblige and I was just as happy to get it on film and share it with you. That said, follow along and see just how easy it is to upgrade those old, worn-out leaf springs for a Bob’s F-100 Parts four-bar setup. CT
