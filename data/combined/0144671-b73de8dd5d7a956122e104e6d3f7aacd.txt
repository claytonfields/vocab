The Tennessee Titans have their man.

The team announced Saturday that it has promoted interim leader Mike Mularkey to the role of head coach.

It's a move that comes as little surprise after Rapoport noted that this was Mularkey's gig "to lose" after the coach was "given every indication that he is getting the job."

Mularkey took over the interim role in November after the Titans fired coach Ken Whisenhunt following a 1-6 start. Tennessee went 2-7 the rest of the way to finish at 3-13 on the year -- missing the playoffs for the seventh consecutive season.

Tennessee had three months to spread a wide net for their next coach, but opted for a tight search that included interviews with Lions defensive coordinator Teryl Austin, Jaguars assistant head coach Doug Marrone and Titans defensive play-caller Ray Horton.

Mularkey's hiring comes after Jon Robinson, the former director of player personnel for the Bucs, was named Tennessee's new general manager. Robinson's former ties to New England left some to wonder if Patriots play-caller Josh McDaniels might get a chance to audition for the chance to coach second-year quarterback Marcus Mariota.

Instead, the task falls to Mularkey, who flamed out in Buffalo and Jacksonville and holds an 18-39 career record as a head/interim coach in the NFL.
