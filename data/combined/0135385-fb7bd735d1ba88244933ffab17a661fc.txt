Alberta Energy Minister Marg McCuaig-Boyd is embarking on a $33,000-trade mission to China.

The NDP government says the mission aims to encourage energy investment in Alberta and share environmental best practices with China’s largest oil and gas companies, which account for roughly 80 per cent of China’s refining capacity and more than $35 billion in investments in the province.

"China represents enormous potential as both a customer and investor for Alberta’s energy industry," said McCuaig-Boyd.

"Maintaining strong relationships with the world’s largest energy consumer will open future opportunities for Alberta as a global energy supplier."

McCuaig-Boyd will be joined by business delegates from several oil and gas companies on the mission from Oct. 10 to Oct. 16, including Suncor, Encana, and Enbridge.

The minister will attend the 5th Annual Asia Shale Gas Summit in Shanghai and a China-Alberta Petroleum Centre board meeting in Beijing.

The estimated mission cost for the minister, one political staff, and two public servants is $33,000.
