Welcome!

If you could simply flick a switch and then begin to make lasting changes to your life, there would be no reason for this guidebook to exist.

The fact is, making lasting changes to your life is tough, which is probably why 92% of people fail at their New Year’s resolutions every year.1 That’s what drove me and a few friends to put together this guide. (Here’s who worked on this guide, and here’s a little about my A Year of Productivity project, which I started eight months ago.)

This guidebook will walk you through everything you need to do to keep your resolutions this year, including stepping back from your life to pick your resolutions, making a plan, and then working to keep that plan by clearing your mind, cutting out distractions, and getting it done. I’m so confident in what’s in these pages that I’ll make you a personal guarantee: if you follow everything contained within this book, you will keep your New Year’s Resolutions this year.

I can’t promise you that it will be easy to keep your resolutions, because to be honest, a lot of the time it won’t be. But if you are willing to put in the time and effort, I promise I will give you the tools you need to make the changes you want to make.

Alright, ready to jump in? Let’s do this.
