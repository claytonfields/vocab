Penguin receives honours in a tradition that was introduced in the early 1970s by a young Norwegian lieutenant

He wore an impeccable black and white coat, and his right sleeve was adorned with medals.

Colonel-in-chief of the Norwegian army Nils Olav stood to attention as he received a knighthood this morning in front of 30 members of the Norwegian guard at Edinburgh zoo.

Waddling out to receive the honour, his belly full of blue whiting fish, and standing at around 2 feet 8 inches high, he must have been the shortest knight in history.

There was much fanfare: music, speeches and even a special message from King Harald V as the Norwegian guardsmen, who are in Edinburgh preparing to perform at the city's military tattoo, looked on.

Darren McGarry, animal collection manager at the zoo, said: "Nils always recognises the Norwegian guardsmen when they come to visit him.

"He loves the attention he receives at the ceremony and takes his time inspecting the troops.

"We're all very excited about his new promotion."

The practice of honouring penguins at Edinburgh zoo began in the early 1970s when a young lieutenant from the Norwegian army Nils Egelien fell in love with the penguin colony and happened upon the idea of having one of the king penguins as a regimental mascot and honorary member.

Six-year-old Nils is the third penguin to take the role of receiving the honour after the original animal died in the 1980s.
