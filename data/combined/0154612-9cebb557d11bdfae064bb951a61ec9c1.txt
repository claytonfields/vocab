Boogie, a brown lab from Indiana, completed most of the half-marathon he inadvertently entered after escaping his owner Saturday.

After finishing the race in two hours and 15 minutes, beating over half of the race's competitors, the dog was taken to Animal Control by authorities.

Kim Arney, a participant who lost her partner near the start of the race, said Boogie ran alongside her until he was taken away.

"I lost my race buddy about mile 4 or 5 and picked up a new one around mile 10," she explained.

Boogie escaped from his leash, for the fourth time this week, the night before the race. His owner Jerry Butts found him after Evansville Police posted a photo of the dog on their Facebook page.

According to Butts, Boogie has been napping constantly since participating in the marathon -- for which he even won a medal -- and is now set to be microchipped and neutered.
