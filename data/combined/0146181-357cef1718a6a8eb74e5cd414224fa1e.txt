Such condolences would become a familiar refrain. Of the 70,000 or so Americans who live to be 100, only some two dozen are typically alive at 110.

Once that milestone is reached, as Mr. Clement quickly learned, the chance of dying within the next year is roughly 50 percent. After 113, the odds are closer to 66 percent. The oldest person on record, Jeanne Calment, was 122 when she died in 1997; only one other person is known to have lived beyond age 118.

“Even while you’re packing the car, the person may fall ill and say they’re not up to it,” Mr. Clement said, after the first of several plans for me to observe a DNA donation was abruptly canceled.

Mr. Clement could extract DNA from post-mortem samples, with permission from the family and assuming he could reach the funeral home in time. Exhumation is also possible, in theory, to obtain samples.

But for understandable reasons, he said, family members most often ended communications with him at the time of a supercentenarian’s death. To improve the odds of getting samples — and the gender balance, since supercentenarians are nearly all women — he lowered his target age from 110 to 106.

“It’s better to get there when they’re alive,” he said.

Guided by the World’s Oldest People email list, whose moderator, Robert D. Young, verifies ages on behalf of Guinness World Records and tracks supercentenarians for the Gerontology Research Group, Mr. Clement placed decal dots designating the locations of prospective participants on a map pinned to the wall of his home office.

He created Google alerts for the phrases “109th birthday,” “110th birthday,” and “111th birthday,” and for the obituaries of known supercentenarians.
