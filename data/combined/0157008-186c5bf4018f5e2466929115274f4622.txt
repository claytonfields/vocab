A Ku Klux Klan grand dragon endorsed Democratic presidential candidate former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton this week, saying he switched his support to her from Republican candidate Donald Trump because he likes her “hidden agenda.”

“We want Hillary Clinton to win,” Will Quigg, a grand dragon of the mostly defunct Klan’s California chapter, told The Telegraph in a Monday article. “She is telling everybody one thing, but she has a hidden agenda. She’s telling everybody what they want to hear so she can get elected, because she’s Bill Clinton’s wife, she’s close to the Bushes. Once she’s in the presidency, she’s going to come out and her true colors are going to show.”

“I cannot reveal my sources,” he added. “It’s my opinion – if you know what I mean, wink, wink. I don’t want her to come back and say I’m slandering her.”

Quigg is responsible for Klan recruitment in the Western United States. He tweeted an endorsement of Trump last year: “You sir are the only hope we have of getting WHITE AMERICA BACK!”

Trump has repeatedly denounced support of the Klan and white supremacists, after former Klan grand wizard David Duke also recently endorsed him. Quigg told The Telegraph “we have nothing to do with David Duke,” hinting it played a role in his endorsement of Hillary.

“Border policies are going to be put in place,” Quigg told The Telegraph, referring to a Hillary presidency. “Our second amendment rights that she’s saying she’s against now, she’s not against. She’s just our choice for the presidency.”
