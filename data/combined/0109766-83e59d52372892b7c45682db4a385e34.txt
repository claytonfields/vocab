Ahead of MNUFC’s match this Saturday against the Houston Dynamo, Minnesota United has announced it has loaned defender Joe Greenspan to the Pittsburgh Riverhounds of the USL. MLS has entered into 2017 Standard USL Loan Agreement for Greenspan. This agreement contains a right of recall for MLS, which enables Greenspan to play for a USL club and a MLS club throughout the duration of the loan period (through end of 2017), subject to roster rules and compliance. Greenspan is expected to rejoin MNUFC in May.

Greenspan was acquired in December in a trade that sent Minnesota United’s third-round pick in the 2017 MLS SuperDraft to the Colorado Rapids in exchange for the 6’6” center back.

A native of New Jersey, the 24-year-old Greenspan was drafted by the Rapids with the 26th pick in the 2015 MLS SuperDraft. A graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy and active member of the Navy, he split time among Colorado, fulfilling his Navy duties and on loan to teams including Switchbacks FC and the Charlotte Independence.

Minnesota United faces the Colorado Rapids on Sunday, April 23 at TCF Bank Stadium, presented by the Minnesota Corn Growers’ Association. Kickoff is at 5:00 p.m. and single match tickets are still available. It’s not too late to join the Itasca Society. Fewer than 700 spots remain in this exclusive club as we rapidly approach the inaugural season limit of 11,842 members — one for every lake in Minnesota. A portion of all proceeds from these season tickets are donated to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources’ Loon Monitoring program. Both season and single match tickets are available now at MNUFC.COM or by calling 763.4SOCCER.
