'Midnight Request Line' – Skream Released as a 12" single in 2005, this is the track that broke the mould and transformed dubstep into an internationally recognised sound. ‘Midnight Request Line’ is just one part of the dubstep legacy and this track builds on earlier releases by Horsepower Productions, Darqwan and El-B to name but a few. Skream (aka Oliver Jones) started producing at the tender age of 15 as a part of Big Apple Records in south London borough Croydon. Although he put his stamp on tracks before, ‘Midnight Request Line’ was the tune that became an international dubstep anthem, and a firm favourite for grime MCs Dizzee Rascal, Skepta and Jammer. The mechanics of the track feature ghostly grime-tinged chords that creep in enigmatically over the first eight bars. The sheer power of the skeleton-shattering sub bass and gunshots were enough to impact the scene and influence a generation of bedroom producers, established beat-makers and, eventually, popular music.
