An Amazon story may still surface on The CW, as the network’s “origin story” series about Wonder Woman is being redeveloped.

Speaking with reporters on Thursday after unveiling The CW’s 2013-14 line-up — which includes the new dramas The Originals, The Tomorrow People, Star Crossed, The 100 and Reign — network boss Mark Pedowitz said, “Oh god, yes,” when asked if the superheroine series is still in play.

“It is being redeveloped,” Pedowitz said, “and we’re waiting for the script to come in” — from new scribe Aron Eli Coleite (Heroes), The Hollywood Reporter reports. “We do not want to produce something that doesn’t work for that character. It is the trickiest of DC [Comics] characters to get done,” he stressed.

The CW’s series adaptation of the book series The Selection, however, is “unlikely” to be re-revisited after two failed attempts. Asked where the successive pilots fell short, Pedowitz told TVLine, “We were looking to capture that dystopia that appeals to young adult fiction, and there is a built-in audience for that…. The first time we definitely didn’t get it; this time, they came pretty close,” but not enough to make the network’s short list.
