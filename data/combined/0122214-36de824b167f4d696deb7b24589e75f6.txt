Ashlee Simpson Defends Jessica Simpson's Weight (Photos)





The internet went crazy yesterday after photos surfaced oflooking like she had put on some pounds . The singer performed at a concert put on by Radio 99.9 Kiss in conjunction with an annual chili cook-off in Pembroke Pines, Florida on Sunday.

Jessica's little sister Ashlee Simpson is disgusted with all the attention that the news is giving to her sister's weight. Ashlee took the time to address this situation on her blog.



"Since when did a woman's weight become newsworthy. A week after the inauguration and with such a feeling of hope in the air for our country, I find it completely embarrassing and belittling to all the women to read about a woman's weight or figure. All women come in different shapes, sizes and forms and because you're a celebrity, there shouldn't be a different standard."

Ok, we don't think she's overweight, what we do think is that her stylist is to blame and that person should get fired ASAP. Those awful high-waisted pants would make anyone look like they have put on a few pounds and the belt right under her chest isn't doing anything positive for her figure either.

More photos below, including a few from her 'daisy duke' days.
