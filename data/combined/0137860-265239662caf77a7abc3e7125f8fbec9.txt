When does Concepts ever get a sneaker collaboration wrong? Their partnerships with footwear brands are always epic and for their 2015 grand finale they are crossing the finish line with a racing-themed New Balance 998 silhouette.

The New Balance 998 "Grande Tourer" is inspired by the GT automobile and it’s duality of luxury and performance. The supple suede upper takes it’s cues from the European road maps that were used to navigate the cars while touring the country in comfort and style. A vibrant pop of red on the tongue and heel offsets the otherwise mellow feel of the greys and greens while a carbon fiber heel shank injects even more personality.

As with most Concepts collaborations you can expect to see these released in limited numbers with a special event attached.

On Dec. 26, Concepts NYC is launching this great-looking shoe with the help of Classic Cars Club, while on the West Coast, clothing store Period Correct will have vintage cars on display as well as the sneakers.

The limited-edition collaboration will be available for in-store purchase at both locations, beginning at 10AM EST and PST on Dec. 26 for $215. If you can't make it to either events, Concepts online store will have them at 12PM ET on Dec. 26.
