Andy Reid will not be coaching in his native Southern California, according to ESPN’s Adam Schefter.

Schefter reported that Reid -- who is expected to be fired by the Eagles -- is planning to coach in 2013, but the Chargers are not expected to pursue him. The Chargers are expected to fire Norv Turner soon.

I don’t have a problem with the Chargers not being interested in Reid. Last year, I actually thought it was a fit. But Reid seems tired and the Chargers need a burst of energy. I think San Diego might be better off identifying a younger coach who has big potential.

This is an important hire and I'm not sure Reid is the right guy for the Chargers at this time.

Meanwhile, NFL Network reported San Diego owner Dean Spanos is handing the reins to his son, John Spanos, as the day-to-day operator of the team. That has not been expected. John Spanos has long been considered a key part of the organization.

The Spanos family will be busy. Turner and general manager A.J. Smith are expected to be fired. The team is expected to hire a general manager (in-house candidate Jimmy Raye is considered a favorite) and then the team will hire a coach.
