He joins Steve Carell in the eagerly-anticipated threequel

Trey Parker, co-creator of South Park and the voice of Eric Cartman and Stan Marsh, has signed up for a key role in Despicable Me 3.

He will provide the voice of the threequel’s main villain, a former child star called Balthazar Bratt who is “driven to supervillainy as a result of the abrupt cancellation of his TV series when he hit puberty”, producer Chris Meledandri revealed at CinemaCon 2016 in Las Vegas yesterday (April 13).

Bratt is “a character clearly stuck in the 80s,” Melendandri told publications including Entertainment Weekly, while also announcing that Steve Carell will voice two roles in the threequel: his regular Despicable Me character Gru and his previously unseen long-lost brother, Dru, who is apparently very different from Gru.

Despicable Me 3 is set for release on June 30, 2017. Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio, who wrote the screenplays for the franchise’s first two movies, have also been hired to script the third instalment.

Despicable Me and Despicable Me 2 were huge box office hits in 2010 and 2013, but both were eclipsed by last year’s spin-off film Minions, which grossed over $1.159 billion (£820 million) worldwide to become the 11th highest-grossing film of all time.
