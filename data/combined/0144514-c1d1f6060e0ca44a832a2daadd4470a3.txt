Matt Todd gets an offload away for Canterbury against Otago on Sunday.

Matt Todd is set for at least four weeks on the sidelines after scans revealed a fracture in his left hand.

The 29-year-old, who was an unlucky omission from the All Blacks Rugby Championship squad, picked up the injury during Canterbury's 30-24 Ranfurly Shield defence against Otago on Sunday.

He played the full 80 minutes against Otago, making telling run in the lead-up to the try which put Canterbury back into the lead late in the game.

But Todd saw a specialist on Monday who confirmed the injury.

He will be in a splint for four weeks at which stage he will be reviewed by the specialist before being cleared to play.

The injury is an unfortunate blow for the eight-test All Black with it ruling him out as a possible cover should Sam Cane have continued issues following his concussion against the Wallabies on Saturday night.

Canterbury's deep loose forward stocks should see them handle his absence with Jed Brown set for an extended stint in the No 7 jersey.

Todd missed Canterbury's opening match of the season against Tasman to take an additional week of rest after an long Crusaders season.

Canterbury are on the road against Hawke's Bay on Friday.

Todd's injury means he will miss at least two Ranfurly Shield challenges against Southland and Counties Manukau.
