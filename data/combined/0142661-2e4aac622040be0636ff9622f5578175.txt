Salman Khan has dispatched 2500 tankers with a storage capacity of 2,000 litres to the drought hit region of Aurangabad in Maharashtra.

Salman Khan has always been known to be a man with a heart of gold.

This gesture comes through Salman Khan's NGO 'Being Human' which has taken a keen interest in aiding the grief stricken families of the drought hit regions in Maharashtra.

The foundation will provide water tankers to the drought affected districts of Marathwada from May 6 to 31, according to an e-mail received recently by the Aurangabad Divisional Commissioner from Salman Khan's 'Being Human' Foundation.

Salman's Being Human would supply 750 water tankers to Beed, 500 each to Osmanabad and Jalna, and 250 each to Aurangabad and Nanded.

People of the Marathwada region have been facing acute water scarcity caused by uneven distribution of rainfall in the state. (With PTI inputs)
