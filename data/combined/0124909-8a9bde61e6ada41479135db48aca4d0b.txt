What a long, straunge trip yt hath been. Tyme sufficeth me nat to tellen yow of the wonderes of Las Vegas, and of the grete battes and swich that ich sawe whanne ich did dryven wyth my lord Kynge Richard from Barstow to Vegas-ward, and of the serious mead collecioun that a man can get whan he sette hym out to fynde a serious mead collecioun, and of the grete feere and loathinge that did posses us.The Lords Appellant aren all crookes and berers of false-tidinges, and Thomas Favent ys the maner of man that gooth to Blazinge Fellow and yet hath nat tyme to visit his grand-dame. The re-brandinge of my blog plesid me nat, and so ich haue taken it y-back. Fight the powere, sistren and brethren.Ich wryte this pooste of blog from an "tavern of halydaye" in Grand Rapids in the realme of Michigan, wherat Kynge Richard and mynselfe haue ordrid "Step Brethren" on the "on demaunde." A-morwe, we get back yn to the car and dryve to that place of which Sir John Maundeville whilom descrived yn this blog:Kalamazoo.
