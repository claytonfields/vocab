Just last week, Nevermen -- the supergroup featuring Faith No More ’s Mike Patton , TV on the Radio ’s Tunde Adebimpe and Doseone -- announced their very first tour together, but now, the band has unfortunately been forced to cancel the string of live dates.

A statement cites an “illness in the Nevermen family” as the cause for the tour’s cancelation. However, it also adds “the bands hope to reschedule the shows in the near future.” All tickets for the canceled shows will be refunded. The affected dates -- which included two U.S. stops in New York City and L.A. -- can be seen at the bottom of the page.

Nevermen will release their self-titled debut on Jan. 29 via Ipecac Recordings. So far, they’ve shared two cuts: “ Tough Towns ” and “ Mr. Mistake .” You can pre-order the album at iTunes and the Ipecac web store .
