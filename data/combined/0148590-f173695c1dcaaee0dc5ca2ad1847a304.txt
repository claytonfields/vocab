As reported earlier MGM resorts released a statement on Thursday with ANOTHER timeline change claiming Campos was shot at the same as or within 40 seconds after he first reported shots were fired.

Via ABC News:

Although we prefer not to comment on the details of the investigation, we are issuing this statement to correct some of the misinformation that has been reported. The 9:59 p.m. PDT time was derived from a Mandalay Bay report manually created after the fact without the benefit of information we now have. We are now confident that the time stated in this report is not accurate. We know that shots were being fired at the festival lot at the same time as, or within 40 seconds after, the time Jesus Campos first reported that shots were fired over the radio. Metro officers were together with armed Mandalay Bay security officers in the building when Campos first reported that shots were fired over the radio. These Metro officers and armed Mandalay Bay security officers immediately responded to the 32nd floor. We will continue to work with law enforcement as we have from the first moments of this tragedy as they work toward developing an accurate timeline.

Jesus Campos, the security guard has been “hailed as a hero after risking his life seeking out Stephen Paddock’s sniper’s nest,” according to Newsmax.

It was reported earlier on The Gateway Pundit that the security guard made famous in the Las Vegas shooter story is not even registered as a guard with the State of Nevada.

Is he even a guard?

Why was he there?

Every security guard in the state of Nevada has to register as an armed or unarmed guard with the state’s Private Investigator’s Licensing Board (PILB). This entity’s records are publicly searchable at: nevadapilb.glsuite.us.

There’s no Jesus Campos licensed with the PILB.

This tragic story is getting weirder by the day.
