One of the more memorable stories this season was the Dogecoin and Reddit communities pooling together money to sponsor the No. 98 Phil Parsons Racing entry of Josh Wise.

Thus far the Reddit and Dogecoin community have rallied behind the car. At the All-Star race in Charlotte, Wise won the fan vote earning entry into the race beating out the likes of Danica Patrick.

On Sunday they will return to the Ford Fusion driven by Wise in the Geico 500. The plan for Dogecoin and Parsons is to continue sponsorship into the 2015 season by offering a variety of merchandise.

The car driven by Wise will be a little different this week with Chinese characters appearing on the front end of the car. Provident Metals will again serve as an associate sponsor of Wise.
