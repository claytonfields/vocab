Your closet. Almost. Depending on your current fashion and style, you might be able to work some of your current tops into your 80s style. If you've got big, baggy tops, go for it! Otherwise you might want to hit the stores. Try another answer...

A secondhand store. Close. You should be able to find some real vintage gems in a secondhand store. This will be one of your best friends in your search for 80s fashion. But you shouldn't discount other places as well! Pick another answer!

The men’s section. Not quite! Because 80s fashion was all about oversized tops, the men’s section is a great place to look for something that hangs off the shoulder or over your leggings. Try cinching an oversized top with a gaudy belt. Don't forget to look other places for your 80s fashion as well. Guess again!
